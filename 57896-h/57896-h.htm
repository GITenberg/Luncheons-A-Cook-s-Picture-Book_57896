  <h2 class='c006'>THE BOOK</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>This book is intended as a supplement to the “Century
Cook Book,” hence no general rules for cooking are given.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a book of illustrated receipts, a cook’s picture-book,
intended to be very useful in the way of suggestion. It is
arranged so that housekeepers may more readily make up a
menu, often a difficult task, or may easily find new dishes
to vary the routine of the daily fare.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of various menus, which are impracticable because
they seldom suit the convenience of the moment, lists
of dishes are given which can be quickly read over and those
suitable for the occasion selected. These lists are placed at
the heads of the sections, each section representing a single
course, and each list comprising a number of dishes, any one
of which is suitable for that course.</p>

<p class='c008'>The receipts will meet the requirements of luncheons, but
the majority of them are equally appropriate for dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attention has been given to the garnishing and manner of
dishing, in order to make the dishes pleasing to the sight; for
pretty dishes are attractive and recommend themselves, while
carelessly served ones are sometimes refused on account of
their appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The illustrated dishes, though apparently elaborate, are
in fact quite simple, the pastry-bag and tube, the use of
which is easily acquired, being the means employed to decorate
many of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The illustrations will serve as suggestions, and the taste of
the cook will lead her to use such other combinations as are
suited to her convenience.</p>

  <h2 id='ch01' class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />LUNCHEONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>The midday meal, called luncheon, varies in character
from a very informal service, where the dishes
are placed on the table and the servants leave the
room, to one of equal elaboration and formality with
that of a dinner. As this meal is made to conform
to convenience, it is difficult to give general rules,
as rules are conventions of ceremony, and ceremony
is sometimes disregarded, as in the case where a
larger number of guests are received than the service
of the house admits of entertaining in other than
an informal manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Luncheon proper corresponds to what in foreign
countries is called the second breakfast, or <i>déjeûner
à la fourchette</i>, where people are seated at the table
and served as at dinner. The French breakfast hour,
however, is usually twelve o’clock, while luncheon
is an hour or more later.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The company<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Entertaining at luncheon is as customary as dinner
giving, but ordinarily the company is composed of women alone, men as
a rule not being entertained at this hour, except on holidays or
special occasions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Seating the guests<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>A card with the name of the guest
distinctly written on it designates the place at the table to be
occupied by that guest, and each one finds her place without being
otherwise directed, as the hostess is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>last one to enter the dining-room. If, for any reason,
one lady has precedence over the others, she is
placed at the right of the hostess; otherwise the hostess
selects for that seat the one whom she wishes particularly
to compliment. If a stranger is being especially
entertained, the other guests having been
invited to meet her, she is given this seat of honor.
The hostess in this case presents her as a new acquaintance
to her friends, who afterward may call
upon and extend to her other courtesies.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Invitations<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The invitations for luncheon are the same in form
as for dinner; if the luncheon is a formal entertainment
they are usually written in the third person,
or conventionally expressed in the first person.
An informal note is written for informal occasions.
Under no circumstances should a verbal invitation
be given.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is polite to answer an invitation within twelve
hours. People who are in the habit of entertaining
are seldom remiss in the courtesy of a prompt reply,
for they have probably experienced the inconvenience
of uncertainty, and the embarrassment of
having to fill places at the last minute, and so are
better able to understand the significance of this
social convention.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Dress<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Women wear street costumes or afternoon gowns;
they lay off their wraps, but do not remove their hats.
Men should wear afternoon dress.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The table<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>At luncheon a table-cloth is not used if the table
is handsome enough to permit its omission, but often
leaves are put in which have not the same polish
as the main table and must be covered with a cloth.
The use of a cloth is, however, a matter of taste, not
of rule.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>The polished table requires care to keep it clean
and free from stains and scratches. It should be
very frequently rubbed hard with a soft cloth, and
occasionally a little kerosene or furniture polish
should be used; but what is particularly needed is
plenty of hard rubbing. A varnish polish is easily
defaced, especially by hot dishes, which leave white
marks that are difficult to eradicate. The table top
should have what is called hand polish. This can be
washed without injury, does not easily stain, heat
does not affect it, and with daily care it constantly
grows handsomer. It is better for young housekeepers
to start with a dull mahogany, or oak, than
with a shellacked table, which needs frequent
redressing.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mats<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>To protect the table when no table-cloth is used,
mats are placed under the dishes. The plate mats,
either square or round, are seven to nine inches
across. Mats are sometimes lined with asbestos, felt,
or other thick material to protect the table better
from the heat of the plates. The mats, as a rule,
match the centerpiece, but this is not obligatory.
There is no limit to the variety of centerpieces and
mats. They range from crochet work and embroidered
linen to beautiful laces.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Decorations<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>Except the mats, the decorations used are the same
as for the dinner-table, flowers being the chief and
always the most beautiful resource. The decorations
should be kept low in order not to obstruct the
view across the table and so make general conversation
impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>A large table is more imposing with high centerpieces,
and at buffet luncheons high decorations can
be indulged in. The cold dishes used on such occasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>are susceptible of much garnishing, and are
made to form a part of the decoration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where a large number of guests are being entertained,
as at wedding breakfasts, or where the luncheon
is accessory to some other entertainment, the
guests are frequently seated at small tables placed
throughout the room. In this case, no ornamentation
is attempted other than a few flowers on each
table, as anything more would be an inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lighting<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The lighting of the table requires careful consideration.
Artificial light is not used unless necessary;
but a dark, gloomy table should always be
avoided, and if the room is dark candles should be
lighted. Sometimes half the guests face bright windows,
while the faces of those sitting with their
backs to the windows are in shadow. Shaded lights
in the chandelier will often remove this shadow; and,
if carefully managed, the gas-lights will not be disagreeably
noticeable. This, together with a careful
adjustment of the curtains, will often equalize the
light; but if a blinding glare cannot thus be overcome,
it is better to draw the shades and curtains
and light the candles. In city houses this is frequently
done.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Laying the table<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>The table is laid as for dinner, except that bread-and-butter
plates are placed at the left of the dinner
plates, each bread-and-butter plate having a small
knife laid across it. These plates are small, and are
used for the breads and hors d’oeuvres.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The food and courses<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>At luncheon the soup is served in cups, and, where
the guests are seated at the table, roasts are seldom
presented, the meats being served in the form of
chops, or individual portions; otherwise, the service
is the same as at dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>At buffet luncheons large cold roasts are used, and
ordinarily not more than one or two hot dishes are
served, such as bouillon, creamed oysters, or croquettes.
Cold fish, cold joints, gelatines, and salads
make the substantial part of the luncheon. All the
dishes, including the ices, are placed on the buffet
table at once, and no order is observed in respect to
courses, each person making his own selection. On
these occasions the gentlemen serve the ladies, and
but little extra household service is needed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where the guests are seated at small tables the
service is the same as if all were seated at one table,
and a number of servants are required. There
should always be enough waiters to serve the meal
quickly. An hour and a half is the extreme limit
of time that guests should be kept at the table.
Seven or eight courses are all that should be presented,
and these should be served quickly, but without
apparent haste. The days of long feasting are
passed. People of to-day value their health and
time too much to sit for hours at a time at the table.
The meal should be over before there is any fatigue
or dullness; but on the word of Brillat-Savarin, an
accepted authority on gastronomic subjects, it is safe
to detain guests at the table for one hour. He says:</p>

<p class='c008'>“La table est le seul endroit où l’on ne s’ennuie
jamais pendant la première heure.”</p>
<h3 class='c017'>GARNISHING AND DISHING MEATS</h3>
<p class='c018'>One celebrated French chef says: “Il faut viser a
charmer les yeux des gourmet avant d’en satisfaire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>le goût”; and another, in giving advice to beginners,
says: “A cook should have that artistic feeling
which imparts to everything, great and small, that
harmony of style which captivates the eye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This necessity is well recognized by every good
cook, and such a one tries to give dishes the inviting
appearance justly demanded by epicures. It is not
necessary that the dish belong to the category which
in cooking parlance is termed “high class,” for the
simplest one comes under the same rule and is capable
of being raised to a higher rank by careful dishing
and tasteful garnishing. The greatest cooks are
renowned for such specialties.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is said of Soyer, “for dishing up he was entitled
to celebrity”; and of Carême, “he excelled in everything
requiring perfect taste, and dealt in a new
and very effective manner with the ornamentation
of large cold dishes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There is nothing which so quickly indicates the
grade of the cook as the manner in which she serves
her dishes. One who has no pride in her work seldom
takes time for ornamentation, though garnishing is
the simplest part of her duty. When, however, attention
is given to this branch, even though the result
may not be perfect, it gives promise of better things,
and one may confidently predict for the cook who
thus shows desire to do well that she will attain a
higher degree of excellence in her profession. There
is no class of dishes, from breads to desserts, which
are not more appetizing when made attractive in appearance.
It has been said that “eyes do half the
eating,” and as no expense need be incurred in the
indulgence of tasteful arrangement of the dishes,
there seems to be no reason why the simplest table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>should not share with the most expensive one this
element of success. Care, taste, and ingenuity will
do much to remedy the lack of money, and may
change the standard of the table from coarseness to
refinement. Many suggestions for decorations may
be found in the show-windows of bakers, pastry-cooks,
fishmongers, and of delicatessen shops. Many
of the pieces displayed there may seem elaborate and
difficult to the novice, but they are, in reality, simple
enough when the use of materials is understood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The word garnishing is used here in a broad interpretation
of the term, meaning the general ornamentation
of dishes, whether it be obtained by form,
color, dishing, or by dressing them with those articles
called garnishes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig-198.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>NO. 198. SODA BISCUITS CUT WITH FLUTED STAMP.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For example, beginning with breads, embellishment
is accomplished by means of form and color.
The form is gained by molding and cutting; the
color, by glazing with egg or sugar. A universal
expedient, when short of bread, is the soda biscuit.
These biscuits, when cut in very small rounds of
uniform size, will tempt the scoffer of hot breads;
while large or small crusty rolls, all of exactly the
same size, and baked a golden color, will also make
him forget his prejudices and find excuse in the
delicious crust for eating them. But these same
biscuits carelessly cut or molded or baked would
offer him no excuse for inviting dyspepsia. Toast
looks more inviting when cut into strips or triangles,
or with the corners neatly cut off if served in whole
slices. Any little thing which indicates care on the
part of the cook recommends the dish to favor and
almost guarantees its excellence—on the principle
that straws show which way the wind blows.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>For soups, there is to be found, in any cook book,
a long list of garnishes which may be used. Certainly
a clear soup is more beautiful when a few
green peas or a few bits of celery increase its brilliancy;
a cream soup is greatly improved by a few
small croutons; and so on through the various classes
of dishes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The garnishes for meat dishes are so various, it
may be said that their only limit is the ingenuity
and resources of the cook.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be remembered that dishes which are
served hot do not permit of as much garnishing as
cold ones. The first requisite in the former is heat,
and this must not be lost by time given to elaborate
garnishing. It does not, however, exclude them from
the privilege of being embellished; for if the garnishes
are prepared and ready at hand, it takes but
a minute to put them in place. Hot meat dishes can
also rely on other things to improve their appearance,
such as shapeliness and uniformity; therefore,
strict attention should be given to the cutting and
trimming of meats, to the molding of croquettes,
of meat-balls, or of anything served in pieces, and
also to the dishing of the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>After meat is well cut, if a joint, it should be divested
of all points and irregularities, and of cartilage
which will interfere with the carving, and
then should be trimmed into a well-balanced and
symmetrical form, attention being given to the matter
of its standing squarely and solidly upon the
platter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chops and cutlets should be trimmed into uniform
size and shape. This can be done without
waste, as the trimmings have their uses. Careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>dressing and trussing is essential for poultry, as the
appearance of an untrussed fowl is enough to destroy
the appetite and condemn the dinner. A fowl
should be pressed into a rounded and smooth surface
in order to dissociate the article served from the
thing of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meat should be placed exactly in the center of the
platter, except in certain instances where studied
irregularity is given for special garnishing. To place
chops or cutlets neatly overlapping one another,
either in rows or in a circle, requires some dexterity,
perhaps, but this is acquired by a very little practice,
and such an arrangement not only helps to keep
the meats hot, but is in itself ornamental. The
platter should be in right proportion to the article
served upon it. A large joint on too small a platter
gives the same sense of unsuitableness that an outgrown
garment gives to a boy or a girl, and the carving
of this seemingly overgrown joint usually results
in accidents to the table-cloth. Again, too small a
platter affords no room for garnishing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The color given meat in cooking may be called
its secondary garnish, space being the first. Care
should be taken, if it is roasted, that it be well
browned; if it is boiled, that it be white and clean-looking;
if it is fried, that it be not blackened, but
a clear lemon color. Poultry should have a golden
color that suggests crispness. It is difficult to make
the mediocre cook understand these points.</p>

<p class='c008'>Larding also serves an ornamental purpose. Dry
meats, like veal, and oftentimes fowls, are improved
in flavor by being larded; and it should be so
done as to make it an ornamental feature. There is
no part in the preparation of dishes easier to perform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>than larding, and no novice need hesitate to
undertake it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hashes and minces can, with very little trouble,
be made attractive in appearance as well as in taste.
Hash pressed into a mold, giving it a ring or a dome
shape, then masked or not with a sauce, or simply
turned upon a platter, can be prettily garnished
with eggs and greens. Plain meat-balls and potato-
or hominy-balls can be placed together on a platter
with such regard to effect that the dish assumes the
character of an entrée, instead of appearing like a
makeshift from left-over pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next means after larding in what may be
called natural garnishing is in the employment of
gravies and sauces. No article should ever swim
in sauce, but a little can be used with good effect on
many dishes. A venison steak wet with a currant
jelly sauce, and just enough of the sauce poured
on the bottom of the platter to color it, gives a glaze
and juicy look to the steak which improves its appearance.
A very little tomato sauce under breaded
veal chops or croquettes gives color and emphasis
to the dish. White sauce poured over boiled dishes
gives greater whiteness and often covers defects. In
French cooking, much use is made of masking,
which is often done by glazing and by the use of
sauces. As white sauces will make white foods
whiter, so brown ones will make brown ones browner.
Fitness must of course be observed. If crispness is
a part of the excellence of a dish, it would not do to
destroy that quality by using a moistening garnish.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vegetables as garnishes come next in order of
suitableness and convenience. When vegetables are
placed on the same platter with meats, they not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>ornament the dish, but contribute to the ease of
serving a dinner. When they are used the dish is
called à la jardinière or à la printanière. Probably
every cook knows how to serve mashed or fried potatoes
or green peas in the center of a circle of chops.
Similar combinations can be made in various ways
and of many things. Spinach, beans, carrots, purées,
macaroni, spaghetti, or rice may be placed so as to
form a base, raising the chops like a crown, or
grouped with them in rows, or alternating with the
individual pieces. Macedoine is a mixture of any
number of vegetables, such as peas, beans of various
kinds, carrot and turnip balls, flowers of cauliflower
and any other vegetable obtainable. They may be
mixed together, or each vegetable may be kept distinct
and placed in small piles around the platter.
Small portions of vegetables left over may be used to
advantage in this way. Very little need be used of
any one, and any number may be combined on the
same dish. Potatoes boiled or fried can be prepared
in many fancy ways to make them suitable for garnishing.
Well-seasoned spinach is excellent with
chops, steaks, or roasts. Browned onions are often
used. Meats with onion garnishes make dishes called
à la soubise. Brussels sprouts, hot, are a suitable garnish
for corned beef; or cold, with a French dressing,
are an excellent salad to serve with cold beef. They
should not be over-cooked or they will lose their
shape. Stuffed tomatoes may be used with almost
any meat dish.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vegetable purée, in fancy form, is useful for embellishment,
and may take the place of a fresh vegetable.
Purée is made of any vegetable mashed and
seasoned in the same manner as potato. Navy beans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>lima beans, flageolets, and peas, either fresh or dried,
are so used. The purée can be pressed through a
pastry-bag into forms simulating roses, or placed in
piles on rounds of toast. Vegetables intended to be
eaten with the meats they garnish should be well
seasoned before being placed on the platter; but
where they are to serve only an ornamental purpose,
they may sometimes, as in the case of carrots
and turnips, be used uncooked, as they have a better
color and more firmness when raw. These two vegetables
are very useful, as they are obtainable all
the year round. Carrots are particularly pretty
when small. Large ones sliced and then stamped into
fancy shapes, combined with turnips treated in the
same way, are frequently used for making designs.
Sometimes they are cut into balls, sometimes are
carved into forms simulating roses. It is easy to
make them into cups, using a fluted knife to shape
the outside, and hollowing the center with a potato-scoop.
These cups are good for holding any vegetable
or for vegetable salads.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rice is generally used for borders which are intended
to keep creamed dishes and fricassees in
shape. Sausages cut in halves or quarters, or fried
bacon, make a good relish as well as a garnish for
many meats; they are particularly good with egg
dishes. Paper frills on protruding bones serve the
excellent purpose of concealing these unsightly ends.
They are easily made by folding a strip of paper
lengthwise, then cutting it down about one and
a half inches at intervals of one-eighth inch on the
folded side, thus making a double fringe; next slip
one side up a little, making the fringe round out;
and, finally, roll this around a stick, leaving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>openwork in a close spiral. These frills are used on
the bones of a leg of mutton, on ham, on chops, and
on drumsticks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The green garnishes are parsley, watercress, small
crisp lettuce leaves, green lettuce cut into ribbons,
chicory, and celery tops. These are all edible, and
all have places where they are especially appropriate.
Parsley, which is most commonly used, is preëminent
for convenience, beauty of leaf, and freshness.
In many cases, however, greens which can be eaten
with the dish are preferable, such as watercress with
broiled or fried meats or fish. Parsley may be used
with almost everything in its purely ornamental
function, but it can be chopped and sprinkled over
foods for both its flavoring and decorative qualities.
A woman who has mastered the art of making an
omelet will usually give it this finishing touch.
Parsley should be very green and crisp, well washed,
and dried with a cloth before being used; it may
then be broken into sprigs and placed at intervals,
or formed into a wreath. Sometimes a large bunch,
like a bouquet, may be used with good effect.</p>

<p><span class='small'>NO. 1. LEMONS CUT FOR GARNISHES.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Lemons, like parsley, have convenience to recommend
them, and, like watercress, are acceptable with
fried meats. The acid of lemon is the best condiment
for veal. When they serve the double purpose of
garnish and condiment, they should be cut so the
pieces can be taken in the hand and pressed without
soiling the fingers. This is effected by cutting
them in quarters lengthwise, or in halves and then
in quarters. In some instances a half lemon is not
too much to serve with one portion, but ordinarily
quarters are sufficient. Slices are useless with meats,
except as ornaments. Illustration <a href='#fig-001'>No. 1</a> shows a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>lemon ready to be sliced. It has been channeled so
as to give the notched edges which make the slices
more ornamental. The illustration also shows a
lemon made to simulate a pig. This form can be
used with propriety on a ham or pork dish. The
ears are formed by cutting and raising a triangular
slice on each side of the pointed end, the eyes are
made of cloves, the legs and tail of wooden toothpicks.</p>

<p><span class='small'>NO. 2. EGGS CUT FOR GARNISHES.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Hard-boiled eggs ornament in a variety of ways.
They should be boiled very hard, then cut with a
thin, sharp knife so the slices will be smooth and the
edges clean. Illustration <a href='#fig-002'>No. 2</a> shows plain slices,
rings made by slipping the yolk out of slices, an
egg cut into quarters and eighths, a whole yolk set
into a ring, and a stuffed egg. Yolks pressed through
a colander and sprinkled over creamed meat and fish
dishes, cream toast, and some other dishes make a
beautiful golden covering. Chopped whites in conjunction
with crumbed yolks are used for tracing
designs over salads, minces, and cold pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pickled beets are a useful and effective garnish.
The color gives decided contrast, and the flavor is
a good relish. Sliced beets can be stamped with
vegetable-cutters into fancy shapes, or cut with a
knife into diamonds, cubes, or strips. One can easily
have them always at hand. Two or three boiled beets
sliced thin and put into vinegar will last until all are
used, and should be among the stores in the dresser
awaiting the convenience of the cook. Cucumber
pickles and gherkins are equally useful in point of
color effects, and in giving piquancy to many foods.
They are used in slices stamped into fancy shapes, or
chopped and arranged in lines or in little heaps.
Gherkins are usually left whole, but may be sliced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>giving buttons of color. Capers and olives complete
the list of condiment garnishes, though any pickle
may be used with propriety on cold meat dishes.
Illustration <a href='#fig-003'>No. 3</a> shows various garnishes as explained
in legend.</p>

<p class='c008'>Croutons are an indispensable part of hot minced
meat dishes, creamed mixtures, and eggs cooked in
various ways. They serve also to ornament these
dishes, which especially require garnishing to make
them presentable. Croutons are pieces of bread
browned in butter in a sauté-pan, or moistened with
butter and browned in the oven. Care should be
taken to cut them exactly, the shape depending on
the dish with which they are to be used. For soups
they should be quarter-inch cubes; for minced meats,
triangles more or less acute. Circles, squares, and
strips also have their places. The color should be
light golden, not dark brown; the latter color betrays
inexperience or carelessness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>A cook who has a desire to ornament her dishes can
make an infinite variety of garnishings by combining
various things, or by changing the form and arrangement
of any one of them. Most of the articles
used are within the reach of all. It is even not
necessary to buy articles especially for this purpose,
for odds and ends left over, or those standard stores
always in the larder, will afford enough material
tastefully to ornament the dishes.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be borne in mind that decorations should
not be such as will embarrass the carver.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>VEGETABLES</h3>
<p class='c018'>With very few exceptions, vegetables should be
served <i>au naturel</i>. Meats require all the aids of skilful
handling and tasteful adornment. Vegetables,
on the contrary, have great beauty in themselves,
and the art of the cook cannot rival that of nature.
Therefore a few sprigs of parsley so arranged as to
give a finish to the dish are ordinarily sufficient garnishing.
In those cases, however, where the vegetables
lose form and color in cooking, the skill of the
cook may be employed to restore these qualities as
far as possible. The more a cabbage can be made to
look like itself, the more attractive it will be. This, at
first thought, may seem a difficult thing to do, but the
boiled vegetable can easily be placed in a cup made
of the outside green leaves of the cabbage, and so,
in a measure, present its own beautiful form and
color. Illustration <a href='#fig-004'>No. 4</a> shows a plain boiled cabbage
mixed with a white sauce and so arranged.</p>

<p class='c008'>The color of this vegetable in its natural state appeals
to the esthetic sense of every artist, and many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>a beautiful picture has been made of a field of cabbages;
yet the farmer who sees a man sit down with
canvas and brush before his cabbage patch usually
regards him as a crank, for to his untutored mind
cabbages are associated only with their utility.
Many housekeepers are equally mistaken in their
views about this vegetable, and consider it coarse
food fit to serve only garnished with apologies. Such
opinions are based on error, however, for the cabbage
is both beautiful to look at and delicious to eat.
There are many receipts for cooking cabbage which
make it as delicate a dish as cauliflower.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the case of spinach, since the form cannot be
preserved, recourse is had to molding; the color also
may be heightened by contrast with other colors.
Illustration <a href='#fig-005'>No. 5</a> shows spinach molded by being
pressed into a basin decorated with the whites of
hard-boiled eggs, and with croutons placed around
the form after it is unmolded. Both the eggs and the
croutons improve the taste of the spinach. The
basin was first buttered to hold the egg in place while
the design was being arranged. Crumbed yolk of
hard-boiled egg sprinkled over spinach is another
garnishing for this vegetable which enhances its
green color and gives the dish a better appearance.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>NO. 6. ASPIC OF GREEN PEAS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There are many ways of cooking any vegetable.
These various ways may serve for change, but few
of them are better than the simple one of boiling
and serving with a suitable sauce. Attention should
be given to dishing vegetables so that there is no appearance
of their having been turned carelessly on
to the platter. A neatly folded napkin can be used
under dry, unseasoned vegetables, like asparagus,
artichokes, or corn. The napkin gives daintiness to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the dish, and in the case of corn, when folded over
it, helps to keep it hot.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>COLD DISHES</h3>
<p class='c018'>It has been said above that discrimination should
be made in garnishing dishes; those to be served hot,
for instance, should go directly from the fire to the
table, and not be allowed to become cool while being
elaborately garnished; on the other hand, cold dishes
demand no haste and permit of so much elaboration
that at suppers and buffet luncheons they are depended
upon largely for table decoration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The accomplished cook considers the work on cold
pieces an opportunity for giving examples of his
skill, and the ornamentation of molds and chaud-froids
a kind of fancy work which requires nicety
and taste. Under the head of cold dishes come all
the salads, the pâtés, galantines, cold fish dishes, ices,
and sweets. In each of these there is range in which
to display culinary accomplishments. The skill requisite
for moderate adornment of these dishes is
not so great that one need hesitate to undertake
them. Cold dishes are often more gratefully received
in summer than hot ones, therefore it is desirable
that every cook should be able to serve them
in attractive forms. Again, from an economic point
of view they are desirable, as meats can be served
a second time in cold forms quite as acceptably as
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many meats, when served cold, require to be boned
and pressed into good shape. Ordinary kitchen
boards weighted down serve very well for a press.
The meat, while hot, is put into molds, or is rolled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>in cloth, the ends tied, and then placed in the press.
Small muffin-rings can be used for sweetbreads,
bread-tins or oval molds for other meats. Chaud-froid
sauce is often spread over galantines, and jellied
mayonnaise over cold fish. On this smooth surface
the decoration is laid in some design traced in
fancy cuts of truffle, or in a combination of white of
egg with truffles, cold tongue, olives, and other suitable
things which give color. See illustration
<a href='#fig-114'>No. 114</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Aspic jelly is a principal reliance for covering cold
pieces. It is not masking in this case, for the jelly
should be perfectly transparent, while masking conceals
the material of which the dish is composed.
Aspic is also cut into small triangles or in squares
to make borders, and is sometimes chopped and used
for decoration. See illustration <a href='#fig-003'>No. 3</a>. Aspic is no
longer one of the difficult preparations reserved for
the hand of the very experienced cook. Any of the
beef or chicken extracts stiffened with gelatine, and
seasoned and cleared if necessary, make good aspic.
The preparation is as simple as that of any jelly.
A little care, however, in molding and handling is
requisite for good results. Jellied vegetables are appropriate
to use with jellied or other cold meats.
Small cups are used for molding them, and the pieces
can be made very ornamental. See illustration <a href='#fig-006'>No. 6</a>.
The small forms placed around meat and served with
a green salad make an attractive cold course.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Fancy skewers are much employed on cold meats.
Their office is purely ornamental, so when they are
used trouble is not to be considered. A fancy-headed
skewer is run through, perhaps, a fine red cockscomb,
then a truffle, then a fancy cut of lemon, or a mushroom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>or a carved vegetable. Truffles in combination
with vegetables molded in aspic and quenelles also are
often used. If all these things are impracticable,
one can devise combinations more easily obtained.
A trussing needle can be utilized, concealing the
head in a section of lemon and building down with
carrot and turnip in alternating colors and shapes,
and perhaps using a crawfish, an egg, or an olive
in the combination. See illustration <a href='#fig-007'>No. 7</a>. French
authors recommend that these skewers be employed
only occasionally, so that they may not lose the attraction
which novelty gives them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cracked, crushed, or ground ice can often be used
with good effect. It gives crispness to olives, celery,
radishes, and cucumbers, and enhances the beauty
of the dish as well. With raw oysters it is indispensable,
and with melons very desirable. A free use of
ice on the summer breakfast table will go far toward
inviting an appetite for that meal.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is well to remember that although great elaboration
is possible in cold dishes, it is not necessary, and
dishes can be made very attractive without chaud-froid,
aspic, or traced designs. If the pieces are
shapely, they will look well if simply sprinkled with
chopped parsley, chopped white of egg, or the
crumbed yolks, and dressed with any of the green
salads. Flowers also can be used to aid in adornment.</p>

<p><span class='small'>NO. 8. BOILED FISH IN SWIMMING POSITION.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>FISH</h3>
<p class='c018'>As fish dishes rank with any other kind in point
of attractiveness, and are open to almost as great a
variety of garnishing as are meats, the same general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>remarks apply to them. The matter of shape and
color here, too, has to be considered. A boiled fish
dropping to pieces from over-cooking, or bereft of its
head or tail, is an unsightly dish. It is permitted
to serve fish <i>au naturel</i>, even going so far as to simulate
swimming. This is done by propping it with
a whole carrot laid inside, which gives the fish
enough rigidity to stand upright. Illustration No.
<a href='#fig-008'>8</a> shows a fish served in this way. The garnishing
is white rings of hard-boiled egg, holding sprigs of
parsley, laid along the back. A slice of lemon
sprinkled with and surrounded by parsley, giving
the effect of a medallion, is placed against the side of
the fish. A fish to be baked may be twisted like the
letter S to make it stand upright. A boiled fish,
whether served whole or in part, should appear clean.
No scum from the kettle should be suffered to remain
on it, and no water should drip from it into the
platter. A folded napkin is usually placed under
boiled fish to insure dryness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boiled potatoes are ordinarily served with boiled
fish, and may be used for garnishing, if cut into balls
and cooked so that they are very white and mealy.
Parsley gives color and also a sense of freshness. It
may be used in large bunches, especially when the
fish is cut, or on creamed fish dishes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Illustration <a href='#fig-009'>No. 9</a> shows a middle cut of fish with
potato and parsley decoration. The fish being cod,
the flesh is not sufficiently white to be attractive, and
so it is masked with white sauce, then sprinkled with
chopped parsley. Had the fish been halibut, the
sauce would have been omitted. Hard-boiled eggs
are an excellent accompaniment for boiled fish, and
when not used in the sauce may be supplied in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>garnishing. Creamed fish is pretty with the top
made golden with crumbed yolks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fried fish should have a lemon color and look
clean, dry, and bright, not black or greasy. The
color is secured by dipping them in milk, then rolling
in flour and frying in smoking-hot fat; or, if eggs
and crumbs are used, having white, fresh crumbs
grated from the stale loaf. Fish to be fried is often
cut into slices, or into fillets, but small fish need not
be cut and so lose their character. Smelts are sometimes
turned into rings, or are laid open and the head
drawn through a slit cut in the back. Different ways
of dressing them give variety, and make dishes ornamental
from form alone. If potatoes are served with
fried fish, they should be cut into balls and fried.
Lemons are indispensable with fried or broiled fish.
They are frequently sliced, but are better cut in
quarters so as to give more of the juice, which is
needed for condiment. Lemon sprinkled with chopped
parsley is very pretty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broiled fish is improved by being spread with
maître d’hôtel butter. This gives it a moist appearance,
and is the best possible sauce for it; at the same
time the parsley in the sauce helps to garnish the
dish. Watercress placed around the fish completes
the garnishing and makes the dish perfect. Lemon
and watercress are the best condiments for any fried
or broiled dish. Baked fish will not bear more than
a few sprigs of parsley as garnishing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lobster coral is much esteemed on account of its
brilliant color, and when lobster is served it is well
to use it as a garnish. It may be sprinkled over the
whole surface of a lobster dish, or be arranged in
lines or dots as the circumstances suggest. Shrimps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>prawns, and crawfish make good garnishes for any
fish, whether it is served hot or cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>When dishes are to be passed, the dishing and garnishing
should be such that the portions are easily
distinguishable.</p>

<p class='c008'>An amusing story is told by a scientist of the predicament
in which he was placed when the guest
of honor at an English table. He was a man of simple
habits in his home, and was very near-sighted.
Elaborately garnished dishes were passed to him
first, as he sat at the right of the host, and he had to
break the construction of what he was pleased to call
architectural or master-builder’s dishes, and this
without knowing where their keystone lay, or of
what they were composed. He was thus obliged to
make public exhibition of his awkwardness, as well
as betray ignorance in that branch of his own business,
which left him unable to recognize biological
specimens when they had evolved into their highest
development in the hands of the cook. This story
serves as an important hint that no dish should be
entirely disguised. A lobster should still be a lobster
in form or suggestion, however it is prepared. For
example, should it be served in chops, a claw pressed
into one end would not only carry out the form of a
chop, but would also designate the dish. There is
generally something that can be reserved from an
article which loses its shape in cooking that may be
used to garnish the dish and act as a kind of label.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>POTATOES</h3>
<p class='c018'>Potatoes are a universal dish, and there are an
infinite variety of ways of cooking them: boiling,
baking, frying, all manner of ways to suit all manner
of people, and to accompany all kinds of meats.
Yet, strange as it may seem, it is the food usually
the worst cooked of any that is presented. The potatoes
are too often soggy, greasy, blackened, burned.
The poor cook seems determined to destroy both the
favor and flavor of this useful vegetable. The potato
is mostly starch, and it is not as well known as
it should be that the principle of cooking starch is
to cook it only until the starch grains burst, and then
remove it from moisture, for the starch grains, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>open, readily absorb moisture and become soggy.
Hence we see this vegetable a most delicious dish
or one unfit to eat, according to the skill of the cook.
Mashed potato is served from the simplest kitchen,
but betrays the poor cook as quickly as a greasy soup.
Sometimes one sees an attempt made to improve
the appearance of this dish by pressing and smoothing
it over the top. This makes a hard and compact
mass of what ought to be a light and flaky substance.
Often it is served in a deep dish, which is another
mistake; for the potato, when light and white, is
tempting enough to serve on a flat dish where it may
be seen. Potatoes that are to be served in this way
should be mashed the moment they are cooked, and
not set aside for a more convenient time. They may
then be moistened with milk or cream and be seasoned
with butter, pepper, and salt, in measure to
the richness desired, and whipped until, like the
whites of eggs, they become white and spongy from
the air imprisoned in the cells. Mashed potato may
be served in a great variety of ways. It can be run
through the menu from soup to salad; can be used
for entrées, and can make ornamental fancy dishes
out of even minces and stews. It is invaluable as a
mask for broken dishes; for instance, a leg of mutton
can be made a presentable dish to serve a second time
by filling the cut with mashed potato. In this case
it must be molded to the shape of the roast and be
painted with egg over the top, so it will take color
and not betray the patch. Such expedients are at
times admissible and should not be scorned. It has
been wisely said that “if there is not economy in the
kitchen there will soon be no kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When potato is made into cakes, timbales, or croquettes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>it must have egg mixed through it, else it
will lose its form when cooked the second time. When
used as borders for minces or creamed dishes, it can
be turned into shape with a knife, be lightly pressed
into a mold to give it form, or be pressed through a
pastry-bag and tube into fancy forms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frying is perhaps the method of cooking potatoes
which requires the most skill. Fried balls, slices, or
straws are always excellent with broiled meats, and
at the same time are the best garnish for them. The
height of skill is reached in the soufflé. These small
balloons are something of a marvel, and are seldom
seen except from the hand of a French cook. The
amateur seldom succeeds with this dish, yet it is one
worthy of the practice which makes perfect. To prepare
the delectable soufflé, the potato is cut lengthwise,
or with the grain; the slices must be one eighth
of an inch in thickness and taken off with one clean,
sharp cut, then trimmed to uniform shapes, either
elliptical or round. The slices are soaked in cold
water and dried with a cloth at the moment of cooking.
They are immersed in fat just below the smoking-point,
and cooked for five minutes, or until softened;
are then drained and allowed to cool for a little
time in an open oven, and then immersed a second
time in fat which is very hot, when the slices at once
puff and brown. They should be served at once.</p>

<p><span class='small'>NO. 13.  RING MOLDS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Potato straws are very attractive and seem so light
and harmless that those who ordinarily reject fried
dishes are tempted by them. They are cut lengthwise
of the tuber, first in slices about one eighth of
an inch in thickness, and then into straws the length
of the slices. They cook very quickly in smoking-hot
fat, and must not be left in so long as to become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>brown and dry. They should be crisp and of a lemon
color. The straws can be cut of a larger size if desired,
and are especially pretty if cut with a fluted
knife.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems desirable to suggest to housekeepers the
feasibility of making a specialty of cooking potatoes,
and with them to give variety, which is so acceptable
to those who sit at their board. Perhaps no other
one thing is susceptible to so many changes, and is
so simple to prepare, is so satisfactory when properly
served, and withal so nutritious. It answers both
the substantial and the esthetic requirements of the
perfect meal; it can be suitably served for breakfast,
dinner, supper, and luncheon; it is within the
reach of all.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CREAM</h3>
<p class='c018'>Whipped cream often makes the best sauce for a
dessert dish, and can be used as a garnish. Its use
need not be considered an extravagance. A half-pint
of double cream is all that is usually called for,
this costs but ten cents, and often the use of cream
saves the use of butter, in the same way that water
can sometimes be substituted for milk if a little
butter is added to the receipt to give the richness
which milk imparts.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CAKE</h3>
<p class='c018'>Decorating cakes takes a little time, but facility is
soon acquired, and the time is not misspent, as the
cakes, before being served, can be used to ornament
the table.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>THE PASTRY-BAG</h3>
</div>
<p class='c018'>The pastry-bag is a cornucopia-shaped pocket
made of rubber cloth, of duck, or of any closely
woven fabric like ticking. The point of the cornucopia
is cut off and a tin tube pressed into the small
opening. The bags made of rubber cloth are the best,
as they do not allow moisture to come through, and
are easily cleaned. They cost fifteen cents each, and
can be bought at house-furnishing stores, but bags
can be easily made at home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tubes cost ten cents each, are of graduated
sizes, and have various-shaped openings.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pastry-bag is easy to handle, and is of great
utility where ornamental dishes are desired. It is
used for mashed vegetables, meringues, whipped
cream, drop cake mixtures, icing, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tube, with opening of suitable size, is fitted into
the small end of the bag, the mixture is then put in,
and the bag, gathered over close to the material, is
held and pressed with one hand while the tube is
guided with the other, leaving the material squeezed
through it in the forms desired. It needs but very
little practice to make ornamental designs. It is
well to have at least two bags, one of them large, with
a large tube, to hold mixtures used in quantity, and
one small for decorating with icing.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>FONTAGE CUPS</h3>
<div class='lg-container-l c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 cupful of flour,</div>
      <div class='line'>½ teaspoonful salt,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yolks of 2 eggs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Milk or water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Add enough milk to a cup of flour to make a thin
batter, then add the salt and the beaten yolks. The
batter must be smooth and quite thin. Use a small
bowl deep enough to immerse the fontage iron.</p>

<p class='c008'>Have deep fat smoking hot. Place the iron in the fat to heat it. Dip
the hot iron into the batter, covering it to within a quarter of an
inch of the top; the batter will rise when put in the hot fat and
cover the whole iron. Hold the iron in the batter for a minute, or
until a little of the batter has hardened around it, then lift it
carefully, holding the iron so the batter will not slip off. Immerse
it in the hot fat and cook until light-colored.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a few trials one will be able to make the
cups even and thin. They are also called Swedish
timbales, and are used for holding any kind of
creamed mixtures, or for holding vegetables. They
can be used as an entrée, or for garnishing other
dishes. The cups will keep for some time, but in
this case should be freshened by heating before being
used; and, as they soften quickly, the mixture
should not be replaced in them until the moment
of serving. Illustration <a href='#fig-010'>No. 10</a> shows fontage irons.</p>

<p><span class='small'>NO. 11.  DIFFERENT WAYS OF PREPARING BUTTER.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>DIFFERENT WAYS OF PREPARING BUTTER</h3>
<p class='c018'>Numbers one, two, and three are made by pressing
butter through a pastry-bag with star-tube. In No.
1 it is cut in three-inch lengths; in No. 2 it is
pressed into long pencils and cut when cold into one-inch
lengths; and in No. 3 it is made into rosettes
by holding the tube still until the butter has piled
up to the size desired. These are good forms for
fresh butter, and they should be made as soon as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>butter is churned and worked, as it is soft enough
then to pass through the tube. If salted butter is
used, it must be whipped with a fork until it is soft
and light before being pressed through the bag. The
forms must be dropped at once into ice-water to
harden them. Serve the pieces in a dish with cracked
ice and green leaves. Parsley will do if nothing
better is at hand. Rose leaves are especially pretty,
or a lettuce leaf may be used as a kind of basket.</p>

<p class='c008'>No. 4 are shell-shaped pieces made with a bent,
fluted utensil made for the purpose (see illustration
No. 5, opposite page 256, “Century Cook Book”).
The utensil is dipped in hot water, wiped dry, and
then drawn lightly over the butter, making a thin
shaving which curls over as the utensil is drawn
along. The crook must be dipped in hot water and
wiped clean each time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Butter molded into fancy shapes and served in
this way is very attractive.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>MEASURES AND TERMS</h3>
<p class='c018'>1 cupful means half a pint.</p>

<p class='c008'>1 teaspoonful of salt or spices means an even
teaspoonful.</p>

<p class='c008'>1 tablespoonful of flour, butter, etc., means a
rounding spoonful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sauté means to cook in a pan with a little butter
or drippings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frying means cooking by immersion in hot fat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blanching almonds means taking off the skins.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is done by letting them lie in boiling water
until the skins are loosened.</p>

</div>
<p class='c023'>No. 1. <b>Oranges.</b> Cut off the tops of the oranges. Scrape out
the pulp and draw a narrow ribbon through each
top, passing the two ends through with a bodkin and
tying them on the under side. Drawing through the
ribbon soils it. Tie a bow on top.</p>

<p class='c024'>Loosen the pulp of the orange, using a silver knife,
so it can be eaten with a spoon. Add a little sugar
if necessary, and a teaspoonful of sherry, if desired.</p>
<p class='c025'>No. 2. <b>Salpicon of fruits.</b> Place in the center of a glass plate
some pieces of the pulp of an orange or grape-fruit,
or both mixed together. Arrange around them a
double row of white grapes cut in halves and with
the seeds removed.</p>

<p class='c024'><b>Salpicon of fruits in glasses.</b> This is a mixture of
fruits such as grape-fruit, grapes, oranges, bananas,
and pineapple, or any combination convenient. Divide
the oranges and grape-fruit into sections, then
carefully take off the skins and remove the seeds.
Leave the pulp in large pieces; add enough sugar to
sweeten and a little sherry if desired. Cut the grapes
in halves and remove the seeds. Place the mixture
in individual glasses and add two or three candied
cherries to each glass.</p>

<p class='c024'><b>Grape-fruit.</b> Prepare grape-fruit as directed above.
Sweeten it and make it very cold. Place it in individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>glasses with a candied cherry in the center.
At the last moment add a teaspoonful of cracked ice
to each glass.</p>

<p class='c024'><b>Strawberries.</b> Press powdered sugar into a small cup
or glass to mold it. Turn the sugar into the center
of a dish and arrange around it carefully selected
strawberries. Leave the hulls on the berries and
serve in individual portions.</p>

<p class='c024'><b>Individual pineapples.</b> Cut small pineapples in two.
Cut the ends so the pieces will stand straight. Cut
out the centers and tear the pulp into pieces, then return
it to the cups formed by the skins. Sweeten with
powdered sugar; add a tablespoonful of sherry, if
desired, to each portion. Let them stand a little while
to extract the juice. At the moment of serving add a
teaspoonful of cracked ice to each cup. Serve as a
first course at luncheon, or before the game at
dinner.</p>

<p class='c024'>A variety called strawberry pines are best suited
for this dish. They are sometimes so small that a
whole one may be used as one portion.</p>

them in a dish with a quantity of granulated sugar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and shake them together. The moisture of the currants
will cause enough sugar to adhere to completely
cover them. Turn them off the sugar and serve
at once before the sugar loses its dryness. Serve
them on leaves in individual portions, or pass them

<p class='c018'>Cut hard-boiled eggs in two lengthwise, using a thin-bladed,
sharp knife. Have the eggs boiled twenty-five minutes
so the yolks will be crumby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remove the yolks, mash them, and mix them with mayonnaise
and the trimmings of the anchovies. Just before serving,
fill the white halves with the yolk mixture, covering the
whole top, heaping it in the middle and leaving a rough
surface. Trim anchovies to the right length and lay two
of them crossed over the top of each egg. Set each piece
on a round of bread sautéd in butter. Slice a little piece off
the bottom of the egg to make it stand firm.</p>

<p class='c008'>Serve on individual plates.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anchovies preserved in oil are put up in small bottles and

<p class='c018'>Cut very light bread into slices one quarter of an inch
thick. Stamp them with a cutter into heart shapes. Spread
them thinly on both sides with butter and put them in the
oven to brown; or sauté them in butter. Let them cool, then
lay on each one a slice of Nova Scotia smoked salmon, cut as
thin as possible. Place around the edges of the heart a
border of chopped white of hard-boiled eggs, and a little
crumbed yolk just at the upper point of the heart, making
a round spot. The salmon must not be entirely covered with
egg, so that the hearts may show three colors. Serve on individual
plates, with a small piece of parsley at the rounded
end.</p>

</div>
<p class='c018'>Cut fresh bread into slices quarter of an inch thick, then
into rounds two and a half inches in diameter. Spread the
rounds of bread with butter, season with a little salt, pepper,
and mustard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Split and trim the anchovies to uniform length and arrange
them on the bread in rosette form. Fill the spaces
between the anchovy fillets with the chopped white and the
crumbed yolk of hard-boiled eggs and make a border around
the bread with the white. Use a little chopped parsley in the
decoration.</p>

<p class='c008'>For other canapés, see “Century Cook Book,” page 368.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CANAPÉS OF CAVIARE</h3>
<p class='c018'>Cut very light bread into slices quarter of an inch thick,
then into rounds or squares two inches across. Sauté them
in butter on one side. When they are cold spread them with
a thin covering of caviare moistened with a little oil and
lemon juice. Place on the top of each one a very thin slice
of lemon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Caviare is the fermented roe of the sturgeon. It is a
dish much esteemed in Russia, but the taste for it is not very
general in other countries, so discretion should be used in
serving it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It comes in small jars and can be obtained at grocers’.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>OYSTERS OR CLAMS ON THE HALF SHELL</h3>
<p class='c018'>Raw oysters and clams are served on the “half shell” for
a first course. Blue Point oysters and Little Neck clams are
the varieties preferred. The smallest ones, and those uniform
in size, should be selected. They should be opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>only a short time before serving. The muscle holding the
mollusk to the shell is cut and the oyster or clam is served
on the deep valve.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arrange the clams or oysters symmetrically in a circle,
the beaks turned to the center, on a bed of cracked ice. Place
in the middle a quarter of a lemon cut lengthwise, the top
edge shaved off and the seeds extracted. Rest the piece of
lemon on a sprig of parsley or any green leaf.</p>

<p class='c008'>Condiments, thin brown bread and butter sandwiches, and
biscuits are passed with this course.</p>

<p class='c008'>The condiments (horseradish and tomato catsup, black
and red pepper) may be placed on a dish, and the bread and
biscuits arranged around them as in illustration.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>SOUPS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c018'>Soups used for luncheon are served in cups. Any kind of
soup can be used, but those given below are the ones generally
employed. For other soups, see “Century Cook Book,”
page 97.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig-027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>NO. 27.  BOUILLON CUP WITH SIPPETS OF TOAST AND ITALIAN BREAD STICKS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>CONSOMMÉ OF BEEF</h3>
<p class='c018'>Cut into pieces four pounds of beef taken from the under
part of the round, and the meat cut from a knuckle of veal.
Put them into a soup pot with two tablespoonfuls of butter
and let them brown on all sides. Then add a cupful of
water and let it fall to a glaze. This is to give color to the
soup. Add five and a half quarts of cold water. Let it boil
slowly for five to six hours. An hour before removing it add
soup vegetables, a tablespoonful of salt, fifteen peppercorns,
three cloves, two bay-leaves, a little thyme, marjoram, and
summer savory.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strain the soup through a cloth and let it cool without
covering. When it is cold take off the grease. As no bones
were boiled with the soup, it will be clear; and as the meat
was browned, it will have a good color.</p>

<p class='c008'>It can be made perfectly clear as follows: Pour the soup
off the sediment which has fallen to the bottom of the dish.
Stir into it while it is cold the whites of two eggs beaten
enough to break them. Place it on the fire and stir it until
it comes to the boiling-point; the egg will then be cooked and
have imprisoned any particles which clouded the soup.
Let it boil violently for a few minutes, then draw it to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>side of the range. Strain it again through a cloth. Heat it
again before serving it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In summer this soup is sometimes served cold in the form
of jelly. In this case the bone of the knuckle of veal must
be cooked with it in order to make it jelly. Care must be
taken that during the cooking the water only simmers, for
if it boils lime will be extracted from the bone and it will
be impossible to have a clear soup.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CONSOMMÉ OF CHICKEN</h3>
<p class='c018'>Place a fowl in a soup pot with four quarts of cold water
and let it come slowly to the boiling-point, then draw it to
the side of the range and let it simmer for five or six hours.
If it is allowed to boil the soup will be clouded by lime extracted
from the bones.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour before removing it add an onion, a branch of
celery, a tablespoon of salt, and six peppercorns. Strain it
through a cloth, and when cold remove the grease. Clear it
the same as the beef consommé.</p>

<p class='c008'>A knuckle of veal may also be used with this soup if a
jellied stock is wanted to serve cold.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CLAM BROTH</h3>
<p class='c018'>Boil clams in their own liquor for twenty minutes. Let
the liquid settle before pouring it off. Season it with pepper
and serve it very hot in cups, with a teaspoonful of whipped
cream on the top of each cupful. About two dozen clams
will give a quart of liquor.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CLAM BISQUE</h3>
<p class='c018'>Boil a pint of clams in their own liquor. Chop the clams
very fine and return them to the fire with the clam liquor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>a quart of soup stock (chicken or veal stock preferred), half
a cupful of uncooked rice, a sprig of parsley, and a bay-leaf.
Boil until the rice is tender, then strain the soup through a
purée sieve, pressing through as much of the clams and rice
as possible. Strain a second time. Just before serving,
heat it, add a cupful of cream, and beat the whole with an
egg-whip.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CREAM OF CLAMS</h3>
<p class='c018'>Steam twenty-five clams and as soon as they open remove
them from the shells and strain off the liquor. Chop the
clams, pound them in a mortar, and rub as much of them as
possible through a purée sieve. Put three cupfuls of milk
into a double boiler, cook two tablespoonfuls of butter and
two tablespoonfuls of flour together, but do not let them
brown, then add to the cooked butter and flour a little of the
milk from the boiler to make a smooth paste, put the paste
into the milk in the double boiler, and stir the mixture until it
is a little thickened. When ready to serve add two cupfuls of
clam liquor and the pulp which has passed through the sieve.
Let it get hot, but do not let it boil or it will curdle. Season
with salt, if necessary, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. At
the moment of serving add a cupful of cream and beat the
whole well with an egg-whip. This receipt makes a quart and
a half of soup.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CREAM OF OYSTERS</h3>
<p class='c018'>Prepare the same as the Cream of Clams.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CREAM SOUPS</h3>
<p class='c018'>Any vegetable pulp can be used for creamed soups after
the rule given for Cream of Spinach.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>CREAM OF SPINACH</h3>
</div>
<p class='c018'>Boil spinach until tender, then drain it. Chop it and rub
it through a purée sieve. To two cupfuls of vegetable pulp
add a quart of soup stock, or a quart of milk, or half stock
and half milk. Rub together a tablespoonful of butter and
two tablespoonfuls of flour. Put this into the soup on the fire
and stir all together until the soup is a little thickened. Season
it with pepper and salt and add a half or a whole cupful
of cream. Beat it well with an egg-whip and serve at
once. If the soup is too thick dilute it with a little stock or
milk. It should have the consistency of cream.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CREAM OF CELERY</h3>
<p class='c018'>This is prepared in the same manner as the Cream of
Spinach, using celery pulp instead of spinach. The roots
of the celery as well as the stalks should be boiled to make
the pulp.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'>EGGS</h3>
</div>
<p class='c018'>Egg dishes are especially useful for luncheon, as they
are easily and quickly prepared, are always liked, and can
be served in a great variety of ways. They may be used as
a first course, or in the order named in the list.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>TO POACH EGGS</h3>
<p class='c018'>Drop the eggs into water just off the boiling-point. Let
them cook slowly until the whites are like jelly, but not until
hard. Muffin-rings may be used to keep them in good
shape.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>TO POACH EGGS IN FRENCH STYLE</h3>
<p class='c018'>Use a large saucepan and have it two thirds full of water.
Add a tablespoonful of vinegar. When the water boils
stir it with the handle of a wooden spoon until it whirls,
then drop quickly a fresh egg into the depression or eddy
of the whirling water. This will give the egg a rounded
shape. When the white is set and before the yolk has hardened,
remove the egg with a skimmer and place it on a dish
to drain. Only one egg at a time can be cooked in this way.
Trim the eggs carefully, cutting away all the ragged white.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>TO SCRAMBLE EGGS</h3>
<p class='c018'>Add a tablespoonful of milk, a saltspoonful of salt, and a
dash of pepper for every two eggs. Beat them just enough
to break them, but not enough to make them smooth or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>frothy. Put a tablespoonful of butter into a sauté-pan, and
when it bubbles turn in the eggs. With a fork scrape the
cooked eggs from the bottom of the pan, giving flakes of
cooked egg. If the butter is not allowed to brown, the eggs
will have a clean, bright yellow color.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>PLAIN FRENCH OMELET</h3>
<p class='c018'>Add a tablespoonful of milk, a half teaspoonful of salt,
and a dash of pepper to three or four eggs. Beat them just
enough to break them. Put a tablespoonful of butter into
a clean, smooth sauté-pan. When the butter bubbles turn in
the eggs. When the eggs are a little set on the bottom, tip
the pan a little towards the handle, and with a fork stir
the mixture on the handle half of the pan, lifting the cooked
portion off the bottom in large flakes. When the mixture
is all cooked, but still soft, pile the scrambled part on to the
smooth half, making it high in the center. Turn the omelet
on to a hot dish. This should give a smooth outside surface
of egg, covering the softer inside portion, which is scrambled
in large flakes. It is not well to make an omelet of more
than three or four eggs. If more is needed, make a second
omelet.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>BEATEN OMELET</h3>
<p class='c018'>Beat the whites of three or four eggs to a stiff froth. Add
to the yolks a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, and
a tablespoonful of milk. Beat them well together, then fold
in lightly the whipped whites. Put a teaspoonful of butter
in a sauté-pan and let it run all over the bottom. When it
bubbles turn in the egg mixture and spread it evenly over the

lengthwise. Remove the yolks and mash them. To six yolks add four
tablespoonfuls of crumb of bread, softened with water, one half
teaspoonful of onion juice, and two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley.
Mix well. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan on the fire, add
the egg mixture with enough milk or stock to moisten it, but not
enough to make it lose consistency. Season with salt, pepper, and a
dash of nutmeg. A mushroom or a chicken liver chopped fine added to
the farce improves its flavor. Fill the whites of the eggs with the
farce, and with what is left make a mound on the serving-dish. Pour a
white sauce over it and arrange the stuffed eggs on it; or cut the
eggs in two crosswise and fill the cups with farce, molding it to
look like whole yolks. Cut a small slice off the ends so they will
stand. Arrange them on a dish with white sauce around them.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 2. Boil until hard a dozen eggs, cut them in two lengthwise and

boiled eggs, two fresh mushrooms sautéd, one half
of a truffle, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley,
and two tablespoonfuls of crumb of bread. Chop
all together to a fine mince. Place in a saucepan
two tablespoonfuls of butter and a teaspoonful
of onion juice. When the butter bubbles add the
chopped mixture moistened with enough chicken
stock to make it of the right consistency for filling
the egg cups. Season it with two teaspoonfuls of salt,
one half teaspoonful of pepper, and a dash of nutmeg,
and stir until it is hot. Place the whites in hot
water to heat them, then fill each one with the hot
farce, rounding it to look like a whole yolk.</p>

<p class='c027'>Make a sauce as follows. Beat the yolks of two
eggs enough to break them, stir them into a cupful

eggs. If not soft enough, add stock to make it the
consistency of thick cream. Pour this sauce on a
platter and arrange the stuffed eggs on it in lines or

color. Oysters toughen if cooked too long. Prepare
only four at a time, as more lower the temperature of the
fat too much, and if they are rolled before the moment of
frying they moisten the cracker dust. Place them on a paper

if convenient. Beat the yolks of four eggs into a cupful of
cream, turn it into the oyster mixture, and let it get hot and
a little thickened, without boiling. Turn it into a hot dish

  <h3 class='c017'>FILLETS OF FISH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Fillets of fish are the flesh of the fish freed from the skin
and bones. (See “Century Cook Book,” page 112.) The
fillets of flounder are used to imitate sole, a variety of fish
much esteemed in France and England. Sheepshead and
other smaller fish also make good fillets.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>FRIED FILLETS OF FISH</h3>

<p class='c018'>Marinate the fillets by letting them lie in a mixture of oil,
salt, pepper, lemon juice, and chopped parsley. Take the
fillets from the marinade, roll them first in flour, then in
egg, and then in white bread crumbs grated from the loaf.
Fry them to a lemon color in smoking-hot fat. They must
not be cooked too long or they will become dry. They may
also be cooked by sautéing, using half butter and half lard.
Prepare one fillet at a time, for the covering of flour and
crumbs will become damp if it stands long, and then will
not crisp. If the fillets are small, serve them piled in crossed
layers on a napkin and garnish with quarters of lemon.
If they are large, serve with maître d’hôtel butter or with
tartare sauce and garnish with watercress.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>ROLLED FILLETS OF FLOUNDER</h3>

<p class='c018'>Sprinkle each fillet with salt and pepper. Spread it with
a mixture made of butter, lemon juice, and parsley cut in
pieces, not chopped fine. Fold the fillet over, roll it, and
fasten it with a wooden toothpick or small skewer. Stand
the rolled fillets on end in a baking-pan, put a piece of butter
on the top of each one, and pour over the whole a half cupful
of white cooking wine (California sauterne). Bake them
in a moderate oven for twenty minutes, or until tender, and
baste them frequently. Arrange the fillets symmetrically on
a platter. Put a piece of parsley in the top of each one, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>place in the center of the dish a lemon cut into the shape of
a basket. Sprinkle the exposed pulp of the lemon with
chopped parsley.</p>

<p class='c008'>Make a sauce to serve with the fish as follows: Add to the
drippings, in the pan in which the fish was cooked, a tablespoonful
of flour, stir constantly until the flour is cooked,
then add enough stock to make a creamy sauce. Add pepper
and salt if necessary.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>BAKED FILLETS OF FISH WITH SAUCE</h3>

<p class='c018'>Arrange evenly on a baking-platter fillets of flounder or
of sheepshead, or slices of halibut or codfish cut one quarter
of an inch thick. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Make a sauce as follows: Put a tablespoonful of butter
in a saucepan, add to it a half teaspoonful of onion juice,
cook until the butter has browned, then add a tablespoonful
of flour and stir until the flour has browned. Take it off
the fire and add very slowly one and a half cupfuls of soup
stock, stirring constantly to keep the mixture smooth. Add
a tablespoonful of parsley chopped very fine, a teaspoonful
of lemon juice, a teaspoonful of salt, one half teaspoonful
of pepper, and, if convenient, a teaspoonful of mushroom
catsup, or a half cupful of liquor from a can of mushrooms,
or a half cupful of juice strained from a can of
tomatoes. Pour the sauce over the fish, lifting the fillets a
little to let the sauce run under them. Place the dish in the
oven and cook for thirty minutes, or until the fish is tender.
If the sauce dries away too much, baste the fish with stock.
The cooked sauce should have the consistency of cream.</p>

<p class='c008'>When taken from the oven sprinkle the top with bread
crumbs browned in butter and ornament with mashed
potato pressed through a pastry-bag and star tube, making
a design that will cover the edges of the platter where the
sauce has stained it. Set the hot platter on a second platter
to serve.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Creamed hashed fish can be served in the same manner.
After the fish has been mixed with the sauce spread it
smoothly on the baking-platter, cover the top with buttered
bread crumbs, and set it in the oven to brown.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>FILLETS OF FISH WITH MUSHROOMS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Take fillets of flounder, season them with pepper and
salt. Take half a can or more of mushrooms, a slice of onion,
and a sprig of parsley, and chop them all fine; add a cupful
of stock and a tablespoonful of sherry. Spread a part of this
mixture on the bottom of a platter that can be used in the
oven. Lay the fillets of fish on the mixture. Cover them
with the rest of the mixture, then with bread crumbs and
with small pieces of butter. Bake forty minutes or until the
fillets are tender. Heat the rest of the mushrooms in a little
stock. Place them around the edges of the dish and pour the
stock over the whole if the fillets are at all dry. This dish
should be very moist.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CREAMED FISH GARNISHED WITH POTATOES</h3>

<p class='c018'>Make a good white sauce, or any other sauce preferred.
Cut cold boiled fish in pieces one or two inches across and
heat them in the sauce without breaking them. Use a plentiful
amount of the sauce. Turn the fish mixture on to a platter
and sprinkle over the top a little parsley chopped very fine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Season some mashed potato with salt, butter, and milk,
and beat it until it is light and white. Press it through a
pastry-bag with star tube into rosettes, forming a wreath
around the creamed fish.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>FISH À LA JAPONNAISE</h3>

<p class='c018'>Make a creamed mince of any kind of fish, or use a fish
forcemeat. Canned salmon is very good for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Place the creamed fish on a piece of stiff paper and mold
it into the form of a fish. Roll some pie paste very thin.
Lay a piece of the paste on one end of the mince and shape
it into the form of a fish’s tail. Cut the paste into circles
of half an inch diameter, using a pastry-tube if a small
vegetable-cutter is not at hand. Beginning at the tail, cover
the molded fish with little rounds of paste, placing them in
even overlapping layers to imitate scales, and mold a piece
of pastry to imitate a head and fins. Use half a cranberry
or a turned vegetable to imitate an eye. Brush the paste
over lightly with yolk of egg and place it in the oven to
brown. Slip it carefully off the baking-sheet on to the serving
platter. Trim off the paper that projects and garnish.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>RISSOLES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Roll puff paste about one eighth of an inch thick. Put
a teaspoonful of meat of any kind at intervals on the paste,
about three inches from the edge. Moisten the paste around
the meat-ball, fold over the paste, and press it lightly around
the meat. Stamp it with a fluted biscuit-cutter into half circles,
leaving the meat on the straight side and an inch of
paste around the meat on the round side. Egg the top and
bake from fifteen to twenty minutes in a hot oven.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>VOL-AU-VENT</h3>

<p class='c018'>Roll puff paste (see page <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>) three quarters of an inch
to an inch in thickness. Stamp it with a cutter, or if this
is not convenient use a tin, of the size desired, for a gage;
lay the tin lightly on the paste, and with a sharp knife cut
around it with a quick, firm stroke so as to press the paste
as little as possible; then with a sharp-pointed knife cut a
ring around the form, leaving a border about an inch wide,
and do not let the knife penetrate the paste more than an
eighth of an inch. Brush the top with the yolk of an egg,
diluted with a little water, and set it away to cool. Bake
it in a hot oven as directed for puff paste for thirty minutes,
and do not open the oven door during the first fifteen minutes.
It should rise to about three times its original thickness.
When it is well dried and a good light-brown color, remove
it from the oven and let it stand for a few minutes, then
carefully lift out the centerpiece and remove all the uncooked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>paste. Set it in the oven again to dry the inside.
The uncooked pieces can also be returned to the oven for
a few minutes, and when dry be put back into the shell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although puff paste is better when used at once, it will
keep very well for several days, and will be perfectly crisp
and tender if well heated in the oven just before being
used.</p>

<p class='c008'>When ready to serve fill the center with any salpicon,
place the little cover on top, and set the vol-au-vent on a
lace-paper. The filling must not be put in until just before
sending it to the table, as it will soften the pastry if it stands
in it for any length of time.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>SALPICON</h3>

<p class='c018'>For filling vol-au-vent or patty shells.</p>

<p class='c008'>Salpicon is made of cooked chicken, sweetbreads, veal, or
calf’s brains cut into small dice, mixed with mushrooms, a
little chopped truffle and chopped tongue. One meat alone,
or a combination of two or more, may be used. The mixture
is then combined with enough good sauce to make it creamy.
A white sauce should be used with white meats; a brown
sauce when the dark meat and livers of chicken are used.
(See “Century Cook Book,” pages 80-299.)</p>

<p class='c008'>A plain white sauce is made as follows: Put a tablespoonful
of butter in a saucepan. When the butter is hot add a
tablespoonful of flour and cook them together for a few minutes,
not letting them brown; remove from the fire and add a
cupful of stock. Add the liquor very slowly at first, stirring
constantly to keep it smooth. Return the sauce to the fire,
add a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter teaspoonful of pepper,
and a little cream, if convenient. Stir constantly until the
sauce is thickened. Lastly, add the beaten yolks of one or
two eggs to the sauce after it has been taken off the fire.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h3 class='c017'>SWEETBREADS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Sweetbreads are the thymus gland and the pancreas of
calves and lambs. They are commonly called by butchers
the throat and the stomach, or heart, sweetbreads. The
former is the larger, the latter is the whiter, rounder, and
more delicate.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>TO PREPARE SWEETBREADS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Soak the sweetbreads in cold water for two hours, changing
the water several times. Put them on the fire in cold water.
When they are whitened and firm to the touch, or parboiled,
remove and immerse them again in cold water to blanch them.
Remove all the pipes, fibers, and fatty substance. Roll each
one in a piece of cheese-cloth, draw the cloth tight and tie
it at the ends, pressing the sweetbread into an oval shape.
Place them under a light weight for several hours.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>BAKED SWEETBREADS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Parboil and blanch the sweetbreads. Marinate them by
standing them for two hours in a mixture of one beaten egg,
a teaspoonful of onion juice, one half teaspoonful of salt,
one quarter teaspoonful of pepper, and one tablespoonful
of chopped parsley. Turn them in the marinade occasionally
so they will absorb the seasoning. Roll them in
cracker dust and place them in a pan on very thin slices
of salt pork, and place a thin slice of pork on top of each
one. Bake in a hot oven fifteen or twenty minutes, or until
they are tender and brown. The pork will crisp and the
sweetbread will brown around it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Serve with a sauce made as follows: Brown a little flour
in the drippings left in the pan, then add a little water or
stock, a little lemon juice, and what is left of the marinade.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Stir it until it has the consistency of thick cream and strain
it on to the platter. Place the sweetbreads upon the sauce.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>GLAZED SWEETBREADS</h3>
<p class='c007'>Place sweetbreads, prepared as directed on page <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>, in a
sauté-pan with butter and a few slices of onion. Sauté
them for a few minutes on both sides, then place them in
the oven to finish cooking. Put a little stock in the baking-pan
and baste them frequently to brown and glaze them.
Serve them as in illustration, or place them around a pile of
green peas.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>COQUILLES OF SWEETBREADS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Parboil one pair of sweetbreads. Trim and put them under
a light weight to cool. When they are cold and firm cut
them into dice. Sauté them in a tablespoonful of butter for
a few minutes, then add a cupful of button mushrooms cut
in quarters, a tablespoonful of white wine or of lemon juice,
a dash of pepper, a saltspoonful of salt, and cook them
until tender, then add a white sauce as given below, and turn
over the mixture until it is creamy. Fill shells with the
mixture, cover the tops with white bread crumbs wet with
melted butter, and place them in the oven to brown.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Chicken, turkey, or veal can be used instead of sweetbreads
in the same way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sauce: Put a tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan; when
it bubbles, add a tablespoonful of flour. Cook the flour a
few minutes, but do not let it brown. Remove it from the fire
and add, while stirring all the time, a half cupful of stock,
chicken stock preferred, a dash of nutmeg and of pepper,
and a saltspoonful of salt. Put the saucepan on the fire
again and stir until the sauce has thickened, then add two
tablespoonfuls of cream.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Any pretty bivalve shell of suitable size may be used for
holding this or other creamed mixtures. The illustration
shows pecten and cardium shells.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>TO PREPARE CALF’S BRAINS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Calf’s brains, in whatever way they are to be served, must
be prepared in the following manner: Soak the brains in
cold water for some time to extract all the blood. Trim them,
removing the membranes and fibers, without breaking the
brains apart. Place them in hot water with a bay-leaf, soup
vegetables, a few peppercorns, a teaspoonful of salt, and a
tablespoonful of vinegar. Cook them for half an hour, letting
the water simmer only. When done immerse them in
cold water to blanch them.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CALF’S BRAINS</h3>

<p class='c023'>No. 1. <b>À la poulette.</b> Cut the brains in halves or quarters.
Arrange them in a circle around mushrooms and
pour over the whole a white sauce made partly of
stock, and the beaten yolks of two eggs with a little
cream added after the sauce is taken from the fire.
Garnish with croutons or cut the brains into large
dice, mix them with the same sauce, and serve them
in individual cups.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 2. <b>À l’aurore.</b> Cut the brains into dice; add the chopped
whites of three or four hard-boiled eggs to each pair
of brains. Add a teaspoonful of parsley chopped
very fine, and a saltspoonful of salt. Moisten with
white sauce and place the mixture in a baking-dish.
Cover the top with crumbed yolks, and over the yolks
spread a thin layer of white bread crumbs wet with
butter. Set the dish in the oven to brown the crumbs.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>No. 3. <b>With Hollandaise sauce.</b>  Cut the brains in halves.
Place each piece on a round of bread which has been
browned in butter. Pour over the whole a Hollandaise
sauce, or a white sauce to which has been added,
after taking it from the fire, the beaten yolk of an
egg and a tablespoonful of parsley chopped very fine.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 4. <b>With black butter.</b>  Cut the brains into thick slices.
Cook two tablespoonfuls of butter in a sauté-pan until
it is brown. Lay in the slices of brains and color them
on both sides. Arrange them in a dish, sprinkle them
with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. Add a teaspoonful
of vinegar to the butter, and strain it over
the brains.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CROQUETTES</h3>

<p class='c018'>Croquettes can be made of chicken or turkey or veal, alone,
but are much nicer when the meat is mixed with sweetbreads
or calf’s brains and mushrooms. The meat mixture
must be chopped very fine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Make a sauce as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>Put a tablespoonful of butter and a half teaspoonful of
onion juice into a saucepan. When it bubbles add two tablespoonfuls
of flour and cook it a few minutes without browning,
then add slowly, so as to keep it smooth,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>When the mixture is set mold the croquettes into shapes
pointed at one end. Cover them with egg diluted with a very
little water, to break the stringiness of the whites, then cover
them with bread crumbs. Crumbs grated from the loaf give
a better color than dried crumbs composed partly of crusts.
Fry the croquettes in smoking-hot fat to a light-brown color,
and until a thin crust is formed. Place them on paper in the
open oven to dry and keep hot until all are fried. Arrange
them symmetrically on a platter and stick a paper frill into
the pointed end of each one. These frills are fastened to a
little stick. They can be bought at confectioners’.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is important to use for the sauce stock which jellies, as it
hardens the mixture and makes it easy to mold, while it
softens when the croquettes are fried, making them very
creamy. Stock will jelly if a knuckle of veal is used in making
it. If jellied stock is not at hand, put a level teaspoonful
of soaked gelatine into a cupful of any stock or of milk.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CHICKEN TIMBALES</h3>

<p class='c018'>Lay raw chicken breasts on a board and scrape off the meat,
thus separating it from the large fibers. Put the scraped
meat in a mortar with the white of an egg and pound it to
separate it still more from the fibers, then rub it through
a purée sieve.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soak some crumb of bread with milk, stir it to a smooth
paste, and cook it until it leaves the sides of the pan. This
makes a panada.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take a half cupful of the fine chicken meat, a quarter of a
cupful of panada, one egg, a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash
of pepper and of nutmeg. Beat them all well together, then
fold in lightly a half cupful of cream whipped to a stiff
froth.</p>

<p class='c008'>This quantity of material will make six individual timbales.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Butter the timbale molds well, ornament them with slices
of truffle cut into fancy shapes, or with chopped truffle
sprinkled over the surface. Put the mixture into the molds
carefully with a small spoon so as not to disarrange the
decoration, and fill them to within a quarter of an inch of
the top. Set them in a pan of hot water. Cover them with
a greased paper and poach them in the oven for five to eight
minutes, or until they are firm to the touch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Turn the timbales on to a flat dish and pour around them a
white sauce made with chicken stock and the yolks of two
eggs diluted with two tablespoonfuls of cream added the
last thing. (See Allemande and Poulette sauces, “Century
Cook Book,” pages 279-280.)</p>
<h3 class='c017'>LIVER TIMBALES</h3>

<p class='c018'>Cut two pounds of liver into large pieces and rub them
through a grater.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moisten a half cupful of crumbs of bread and a half cupful
of flour with a cupful of milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fry the slices of half an onion in a tablespoonful of
butter until they are tender, then remove them and turn into
the pan the mixture of bread, flour, and milk. Stir until it
is cooked to a smooth paste.</p>

<p class='c008'>Put into a bowl two cupfuls of liver pulp, the bread paste,
a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, and a dash
of paprika. Mix them well together and add, one at a time,
four eggs, beating in each one well, then add enough cream
to make rather a thin batter. Pass the whole through a
purée sieve. Beat it well again and turn it into molds.</p>

<p class='c008'>This amount of mixture will fill twelve individual timbale
molds and one pint mold, the latter to be used cold (see
page <a href='#Page_127'>127</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Fill the individual timbale molds to within a quarter of an
inch of the top, set them into a pan of hot water, cover them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>with a greased paper, and poach them in the oven for fifteen
to twenty minutes, or until firm to the touch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Turn the timbales on to a flat dish and pour around them
a little good brown sauce. The molds may be ornamented,
if desired, the same as chicken timbales, using the white of
hard-boiled eggs instead of truffles.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>BAKED MUSHROOMS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Cut the mushroom stems off even with the caps. Peel the
caps and stand them on a dish with the gills up. Sprinkle
them with pepper and salt and let them stand until moisture
gathers on them. Cut sliced bread with a biscuit-cutter into
rounds, or if convenient use a fancy cutter. Illustration
shows bread cut with a leaf-shaped stamp. Dip the pieces
of bread into water to moisten them, but do not let them
get soggy. Place them on a baking-tin and sprinkle with
pepper and salt and bits of butter. Arrange the mushrooms
on them, one or more according to size, with the gills up.
Bake about thirty minutes, or until tender.</p>

<p class='c008'>Watch them carefully so they will not get overdone or too
dry. Baste with melted butter, if necessary, while they are
baking.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>STUFFED MUSHROOMS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Cut the stems off close to the gills. Peel the caps. Cut the
stems fine. Sauté all the parts together in butter. Remove
the caps when they are tender and before they lose shape.
After the caps are removed add six drops of onion juice
and a teaspoonful of flour. Let the flour cook a few minutes
and then add a quarter of a cupful of stock and a tablespoonful
of minced chicken or livers, pepper, and salt, and
stir until the mixture is thickened.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Place a little of this mixture on the gills of each mushroom.

<p class='c023'>No. 1. Chop fine a half cupful of canned mushrooms, add
a half or three quarters of a cupful of crumb of
bread and the pulp taken from six tomatoes, a tablespoonful
of chopped ham or of chicken, if convenient,
a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, six drops
of onion juice, a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper,
and a teaspoonful of melted butter. If the mixture
is not sufficiently moistened by the tomato juice add
enough stock to make it quite wet.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 2. Use equal parts of minced meat (chicken or veal
preferred) and crumb of bread, add the yolks of two
hard-boiled eggs. Season with chopped parsley, a little
onion juice, pepper, and salt. Moisten with the
pulp taken from the tomatoes, or with stock, or with
both of them.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>No. 3. Use boiled rice mixed with chopped green peppers,
a few drops of onion juice, pepper, and salt. Moisten
with the pulp taken from the tomato, or with stock.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 4. Boil macaroni, broken into half-inch lengths, until
tender. Moisten it with well-seasoned white sauce,
and add some grated cheese, a little pepper and salt,
and a dash of paprika.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>STUFFED GREEN PEPPERS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Select green peppers of equal size. Cut a piece off the
stem end, or cut them lengthwise. Remove the seeds and
ribs. Parboil them, stuff them with any of the mixtures
given for stuffed tomatoes, using stock instead of tomato-pulp
for moistening. Bake with a little water in a pan for
fifteen to twenty minutes, or until they are tender, but not
so long as to allow them to lose their shape. Sprinkle a little
parsley chopped fine over the tops just before serving them.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>JARDINIÈRE</h3>

<p class='c018'>The illustration shows a variety of vegetables served together,
or à la jardinière.</p>

<p class='c008'>This dish can be used as a course or vegetable entrée, and
is particularly appreciated where one has an abundance of
fresh vegetables from the garden. The vegetables should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>be well seasoned and arranged with regard to color so as
to give a pleasing effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>The combination used in the illustration is a cauliflower,
green peas, string beans, lima beans, corn, macedoine, and
baked tomatoes.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3 class='c017'>VEGETARIAN DISH</h3>

<p class='c018'>After boiling enough rice to fill a ring mold, steam it until
it is quite dry, and until the grains are separated. Mix the
rice with enough thick white sauce to moisten it. Butter a
ring-mold well and sprinkle it thickly with white bread
crumbs (crumbs grated from the loaf). Put in the prepared
rice and place the ring in a pan, the bottom of which is covered
with a very little water. Cover the top with greased
paper, and bake for half an hour, or until the crumbs are
brown. Turn the browned ring on a platter. Fill the center
with any vegetable, and place around the outside fontage
cups holding a second vegetable. In the illustration the
ring is filled with corn, and the cups hold small lima beans.</p>

<p class='c008'>A good combination is baked tomatoes alternating with
fontage cups holding macedoine of vegetables, the ring holding
green peas.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same style of dish may be made with meat. The ring
may be made with mashed potato and hold minced creamed
meat.</p>

  <h4 class='c029'>CASSEROLE OF BEEF</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Sauté three or four sliced onions in a tablespoonful of butter.
Put them when soft into the casserole. Cut a steak,
taken from the upper side of the round, into pieces suitable
for one portion. Put them in the sauté-pan and sear them on
all sides, then put them in the casserole. Add a tablespoonful
of flour to the sauté-pan, let it brown, then add
slowly a cupful and a half of water and stir until it is a little
thickened, season with a teaspoonful of salt, a half teaspoonful
of pepper, and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley.
Add, if convenient, a little Worcestershire sauce and a little
mushroom catsup. The sauce should be highly seasoned, and
such condiments as are at hand may be used. The sauce
will be richer if stock is used instead of water. Turn the
sauce over the meat, cover the casserole, set it in the oven
and cook slowly until the meat is tender, then cover the top
with parboiled sliced potato and return it to the oven for
a few minutes to finish cooking the potatoes. The sauce
should be of the consistency of cream, and there should not
be a great quantity of it. Serve in the casserole.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>FILLET OF BEEF</h4>

<p class='c018'>The fillet or tenderloin of beef is taken from the under
side of the loin. It is the most tender and the most expensive
cut of the beef, costing from eighty cents to a dollar a pound.
The whole fillet is used as a roast. When sliced it is given
different names. Cuts from the middle, which is the thickest
part, are Chateaubriands. The Chateaubriand is cut one
and a half to three quarters of an inch thick, trimmed, tied
into a neatly rounded shape, and struck lightly with the flat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>side of the cleaver to smooth the top and reduce the thickness
to one and a quarter or one and a half inches. It is
cooked and served as a steak.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next pieces are the mignon fillets. These are prepared
in the same way as the Chateaubriand and should be
about one inch thick and from two and a half to three
inches across when finished. They may be broiled or cooked
on a hot pan.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cuts from the small ends are noisettes and turnedos; the
former are cut one half of an inch thick and cooked in a
sauté-pan; the latter are cut one quarter of an inch thick,
and are cooked in a sauté-pan for five minutes only. The
noisettes and turnedos should be brushed with glaze before
serving (see Glaze, page <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'>Grenadines are cut lengthwise from the thin end of the
fillet and trimmed into chop-shaped pieces. They are larded,
sautéd in a little butter, and cooked five to eight minutes.</p>

of the circle with fried potatoes. Lay on each fillet a half
slice of lemon sprinkled with chopped parsley.</p>

<p class='c008'>The center of the circle may be filled with potato, mashed,
balls, puffed, straws, etc., or with a vegetable such as peas,

</div>
</div>
<h4 class='c030'>FILETS MIGNON WITH TOMATOES AND MUSHROOMS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Prepare the fillets as directed on this page. Have
them of uniform size. Broil them over coals or on a hot pan.
Turn them very often so they will cook slowly and when done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>have an even red color all through. The broiling will take
eight to ten minutes. Cover the tops with maître d’hôtel
butter (page <a href='#fig-048'>103</a>), or butter, pepper and salt, and chopped
parsley. Arrange them in a circle on one end of a platter.
Place on each one a slice of broiled tomato (see page <a href='#Page_97'>97</a>), and
on the tomato a stuffed mushroom (page <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>).</p>

<p class='c008'>On one side of the platter place an ornamental skewer
stuck into a shaped piece of uncooked vegetable of sufficient
size. The skewer in illustration has a mushroom on top, then
a slice of lemon, then a row of small carrots strung on a
thread, a slice of lemon to hold the carrots in place, and
then the foliage of the carrots. It is stuck into a raw parsnip
cut so it stands firm. The skewer is for ornamenting the
dish only.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>CHOPS À LA SOUBISE</h4>

<p class='c018'>Put soubise sauce in the center of the dish and arrange
broiled French chops standing in a ring around it. Place a
ring of fried onion over each chop bone.</p>

<p class='c008'>French chops are cut from the rack and trimmed so as
to leave the upper half of the bone bare.</p>

<p class='c018'>Boil six white onions for ten minutes. Cut them in pieces,
put them in a saucepan with one quarter of a pound of
butter and cook them very slowly indeed for a long time or
until they are soft. The onions must cook so slowly that
they do not color. Add a tablespoonful of flour. After
the flour is cooked remove the onions from the fire, add
one cupful of cream, and pass the whole through a sieve.
Add a very little pepper and salt.</p>

<p class='c008'>This sauce should be white and have the consistency of
thick cream.</p>

<p class='c018'>Arrange French chops down the middle of the platter,
with the chops overlapping and the bones crossing. Place
a piece of bread under the first two to support and lift the
bones off the dish; the rest are then easily arranged in a
symmetrical manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Garnish the dish with spoonfuls of horseradish sauce, or
serve the sauce in a separate dish.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>HORSERADISH SAUCE</h4>

<p class='c018'>Grate fresh horseradish root and mix with it enough
whipped cream to make it light and to reduce sufficiently
the sharpness of the horseradish. The horseradish absorbs
the cream, and a few more spoonfuls of the cream are needed
than of the grated horseradish. The sauce should not be
mixed until just before serving.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class='c030'>CHOPS GARNISHED WITH ARTICHOKES</h4>

<p class='c018'>These chops are cut from the rack. They are cut an inch
thick, the bones removed, and the meat turned and tied into
round pieces. They are then struck with the flat side of the
cleaver to smooth and flatten them a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>Broil the chops, spread them with butter, and sprinkle
them with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. Arrange them
symmetrically on a platter and place on each one an artichoke
bottom holding a little good sauce, such as bearnaise
or Hollandaise, or even melted butter, and a few green peas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Artichoke bottoms come in cans and can be purchased from
a grocer. The French ones are the best. They do not need
any more cooking, but should be heated by placing them
in hot water.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>
  <h4 class='c030'>BONED CHOPS WITH MUSHROOMS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>These chops should be cut an inch and a quarter thick from
the loin, the bone then carefully removed, some of the fat
taken out, and the thin end piece drawn around and fastened
with a wooden skewer, giving a perfectly round chop. Have
them uniform in size. Cook them on a hot pan. Turn them
frequently after the surfaces are seared so they will cook
evenly and slowly. If preferred, they can be broiled over
hot coals, but are then more likely to lose their shape and
the skewers will be burned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arrange the chops flat on the dish in a circle with the
skewers pointing out. Cover the top of each chop with a
sauce made of the chopped mushroom stems, and place in the
center of each chop a large mushroom cap. Place a paper
frill on each skewer. Fill the center of the ring of chops
with green peas or any small vegetable, or with mashed or
fried potatoes.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>TO PREPARE THE MUSHROOMS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Select large mushrooms, those not fully opened preferred,
as they stand higher. Cut the stems off even with the caps.
Peel the caps. Chop the stems. Put all in a pan with butter
and sauté them until tender. Remove the caps as soon as
they are tender, and before they have flattened out. Add
a little stock, or water, to the pan, and a little flour. Stir
until the sauce is thickened to the consistency of cream, season
with a little salt and pepper. Use this sauce for the
tops of the chops.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class='c030'>COTTAGE PIE</h4>

<p class='c018'>Peel a good-sized onion, stick into it half a dozen whole
cloves, and place it in the center of an earthenware baking-dish,
or a granite-ware basin, or, best of all, the baking-pan
of a double pudding-dish. Cut any cold meat into small
and rather thin slices. Roll each piece in flour mixed with
pepper and salt. Arrange the pieces of meat around the
onion, filling the dish three quarters full.</p>

<p class='c008'>Put the bone of the meat and all of the scraps into a
saucepan, cover them with cold water, add a bay-leaf and
soup vegetables, and simmer the whole for an hour or longer.
Strain off the stock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Put a tablespoonful of butter in a saucepan with a teaspoonful
of onion juice, let it brown, then add a tablespoonful
of the flour used for rolling the meat, let the flour brown,
then add one and a half cupfuls of the stock and stir until
it becomes a little thickened. Add more pepper and salt
if necessary, and a dash of mustard and of nutmeg, also a
few drops of Worcestershire sauce, if convenient. Let this
sauce become a little cooled, then pour it over the meat, and
cover the whole with mashed potato. The potato should be
seasoned by adding to it a little hot milk, with melted butter
in it, and a little salt, and then be whipped with a fork
until it is smooth, light, and white. The potato may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>put through a ricer over the meat, or be piled on it roughly
and scratched with a fork into cone shape, or be put
through a pastry-bag with star tube as in illustration. In
the latter case it must have the white of an egg mixed with
it in order to hold its form when baked. Touch the potato
lightly over the top with yolk of egg diluted with milk to
make it brown well. Put the dish in the oven for ten to fifteen
minutes, or long enough to brown the potato a little and
heat the meat. When the sauce begins to bubble through
the potato at the edges it is done.</p>

<p class='c008'>The meat, having been cooked already, will be toughened if
cooked a second time and needs only to be heated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wrap a folded napkin around the dish before sending it to
the table in case a kitchen basin has been used. This is a
presentable dish and will be well liked.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>MEAT AND POTATO PIE</h4>

<p class='c018'>Butter a pie-plate, spread over it like an under-crust well-seasoned
mashed potato. Spread it about a quarter of an
inch thick on the bottom. Make a border two inches wide,
and thick enough to rise a little above the dish. Score the
top of the potato border with a fork and touch it lightly with
egg. Fill the center with rare cold beef or mutton cut into
dice. Pour over the meat well-seasoned brown sauce and
sprinkle the top with a few buttered bread crumbs. Do not
let any of the sauce get on the potato border. Place it in
the oven for a few minutes to brown.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>MINCED MEAT WITH POTATO RINGS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Mince any kind of meat. Make it creamy with brown
sauce for dark meat, or with white sauce for veal or chicken;
or moisten the minced meat with stock, add pepper and salt,
a few drops of onion juice, and, if convenient, a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>tomato. Chopped mushrooms added to the mince improve
it very much. Spread the creamed mince flat on the dish,
or form a mound as in illustration. Sprinkle the top with
crumbs browned in butter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mash some boiled potatoes, season them with butter, salt,
and enough milk to moisten them well, and one or two
beaten eggs; one egg is enough for a pint of potato. Beat the

with star tube into rings. Paint the rings with yolk of
egg diluted with a little milk and put them in the oven to

not brown. Add half a cupful of clean, unwashed rice, and
stir until it is a light yellow, then add two cupfuls of stock
and cook without stirring for twenty minutes. The rice
should be tender and the stock should be absorbed. Add
a tablespoonful of grated cheese and a little salt. Turn

half milk and half stock (page <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>). Use enough of the sauce
to make it quite creamy. If it is to be molded it cannot be
quite as soft as when it is to be served in a vegetable-dish.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 1. Fill thoroughly buttered individual timbale molds

of pepper and a half teaspoonful of salt. Turn the
sauce over the chicken, add a bay-leaf, a few potato balls,
and, if convenient, a tablespoonful of sherry and a few mushrooms.
Cover the casserole, put it in the oven, and cook
slowly until the chicken is tender. If the sauce becomes too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>dry add enough water or stock to make it the consistency

each of salt, thyme, and onion juice, and a quarter

add a tablespoonful of flour and cook them together
for a few minutes, but do not let them brown. Remove from
the fire and add a cupful of milk, very slowly so as to keep
it smooth; stir all the time. Add a half teaspoonful of salt
and a saltspoonful of pepper. Return it to the fire and cook
until it is thickened to a creamy consistency. The sauce is
richer if half stock and half milk are used. It is also improved
for some uses by adding the yolks of one or two eggs. If
yolks are used they are stirred in after the sauce is taken
from the fire, as it is still hot enough to cook the egg sufficiently.
(See Sauces, “Century Cook Book,” pages 275-277.)</p>
<h4 class='c030'>BROWN SAUCE</h4>

<p class='c018'>This is made in the same way and with the same proportions

<p class='c018'>Put in a soup pot bits of fat cut from meat and let them
try out enough to moisten the bottom of the pot; or use a
tablespoonful of butter for this purpose. Add four pounds
of lean beef cut into pieces and let them brown, turning them
a few times, then add a half cupful of hot water and let the
whole cook until the juices are reduced to a glaze in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>bottom of the pot. This is to give color to the stock. Add
six quarts of cold water and the knuckle of veal, and let the
mixture simmer for six hours. If the water is allowed to boil
the lime will be extracted from the bone and the stock will
be clouded. After three hours’ simmering add the soup vegetables,
consisting of two stalks of celery, one onion, a few
sprigs of parsley, a piece of carrot, three cloves, a bay-leaf,
a saltspoonful each of thyme and marjoram, fifteen peppercorns,
and a tablespoonful of salt. After six hours’ simmering
strain the stock through a cloth laid on a colander, and
let it cool. You have now a soup stock. The next day remove
the grease, turn the stock into a saucepan carefully
so that no sediment goes in, and let it boil, uncovered, until
reduced to a thin paste. The stock is now glaze. Be careful
toward the end of the cooking that the stock does not
burn. Turn the glaze into a small jar and put a little melted
butter over the top to exclude the air. When ready to use
it heat a little of the glaze to soften it and apply it with
a brush.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>SWEET SAUCES FOR PUDDINGS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Hard sauce is made of butter, sugar, and flavoring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Use twice the quantity of sugar that you have of butter.
Beat them together for a long time, or until they are very

an egg may be added to white sauce.</p>

<p class='c008'>To half a cupful of butter and a cupful of sugar add for
flavoring one tablespoonful of wine, or two teaspoonfuls of
lemon juice, and one teaspoonful of grated lemon-rind, or

<p class='c018'>Any of the water-ices can be made into punches by adding
to them when half frozen the whipped whites of two eggs
which have had a tablespoonful of hot sugar syrup stirred
into them to cook the eggs. The eggs must be cold when
added to the ice, and the freezing continued until the ice is
sufficiently stiff. At the moment of serving pour over each
glassful a teaspoonful or a tablespoonful of liquor.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grate half a pound of American cheese. Mix in it a scant
tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of milk, an egg
beaten enough to break it, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a
dash of paprika. Mix to a smooth paste and mold into small
croquettes, using a tablespoonful of the paste for each croquette.

<p class='c008'>Add a little milk to the yolk of an egg and roll the croquettes
in this and then in cracker dust. Then fry them for
a minute in smoking-hot fat. They should have a delicate

<div class='lg-container-l c035'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>3 tablespoonfuls of oil,</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of vinegar,</div>
      <div class='line'>½ teaspoonful of salt,</div>
      <div class='line'>¼ teaspoonful of pepper.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mix the salt and pepper with the oil, then add slowly the
vinegar, stirring all the time. It will become a little white
and thickened.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h4 class='c030'>MAYONNAISE DRESSING</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>To the yolk of an egg add oil very slowly until the mixture
becomes very thick, then add alternately vinegar and
oil. Lastly add salt and pepper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The proportions are one cupful of oil to one yolk, one half
teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, and one and a half
tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon juice. More or less oil
may be used, but it must be added very slowly at first or the
mixture will curdle. Have all the ingredients cold before
beginning to mix the dressing. (See “Century Cook Book,”
page 288.)</p>
<h4 class='c030'>CREAM DRESSING</h4>

<p class='c018'>Add whipped cream to mayonnaise or plain cream to
French dressing at the moment of mixing them with the
salad. The proportions need not be exact: a little more or
less cream can be used as convenient.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Note</span>.—An onion rubbed on the dish in which lettuce is
to be served improves the salad.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>PREPARING SALADS</h4>

<p class='c018'>It is essential that leaf salads and celery be dry. Oil and
water do not mix, and if the salad is wet the dressing will
run off it and also lose its flavor. They should also be crisp
and clean. Divest them of imperfect portions and wash to
free them of dust and grit. Examine lettuce for a small
green insect and celery for a small white worm which infest
them, then place them in cold water to refresh and crisp
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dry them carefully, shaking lettuce or watercress in a wire
basket, or carefully dry each piece in a clean napkin. Celery
may be drained or wiped. The salad may be dried sometime
before using it, and if kept near the ice will retain its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>crispness, but the dressing must not be put on until the moment
of serving, as it wilts the leaves. The same rule applies
to vegetables used as salads: they should be dry and cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>There need be no waste in lettuce. The imperfect and
hard leaves may be boiled and used as directed on page <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>
for green eggs. The rejected outside leaves of one head will
be enough for one or two eggs, or they may be used with
other odds and ends of vegetables to give a macedoine garnishing
to a meat dish.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>SALADS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Of the many articles used for salad, lettuce is preëminently
first in favor. It is the king of salads; and, whatever else is
used, lettuce usually forms part of the dish to make it complete.
A plain lettuce is always acceptable and can be served
in several forms. Combined with one or more articles equally
common, a number of bouquet salads can easily be made, giving
dishes attractive both in taste and color. The bouquet
salads should be placed on flat dishes in order to show the
arrangement, color, and variety of articles used.</p>

<p class='c008'>A variety in salads is desirable; and, as they can be eaten
every day, a little change in the combinations will give
variety.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use of nasturtium blossoms is recommended. They are
not only beautiful to look at and decorative, but have a
piquant flavor. Combinations of green such as are obtained
by lettuce and watercress are pleasing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the illustrations a number of combinations are given
which will suggest others.</p>

<p class='c018'>Make a chicken stock as for chicken consommé, page <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>.
Use a knuckle of veal and as many quarts of water as you
have pounds of meat. Remove the breast of the fowl when it
is tender. Clarify the stock, and if it has not made a jelly
firm enough to stand add a little gelatine,—a tablespoonful
of granulated gelatine to a quart of stock will perhaps be
more than enough, for the jelly must not be too hard, and the
jellied stock may need but very little extra stiffness to make
it hold its shape when molded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ornament the bottom of a ring-mold with slices of the
white of hard-boiled egg cut into diamond-shaped pieces.
Lay the pieces, with thin strips of egg between them, in a
manner to imitate a wreath of leaves. A long pin will be
useful in arranging the pieces of egg. Put the mold in a
bowl of cracked ice, and with a spoon add a very little liquid
jelly, taking care not to use enough to float the pieces of egg.
When it has set sufficiently to hold the decoration in place
add enough more jelly to make a layer a quarter of an inch
thick. When the layer has stiffened, put in a layer of
chicken breast cut into inch lengths, so the jelly will not be
torn apart when being served, but place the pieces close together
so they appear like large pieces. Add more jelly, letting
it rise a quarter of an inch above the chicken; when that
has stiffened, add another layer of chicken and fill the mold
with jelly. Let the mold be level and have a smooth layer
of gelatine on top, so when unmolded it will stand firm and

<p class='c018'>Make a chicken aspic as directed above. When a mold is
used which has projections on top, as in illustration, the jelly
must be made a little firmer than for a plain mold. Pour
into the mold a layer of jelly, let it stiffen, and then add a
layer of pâté de foie gras and a little jelly to set it. Then
fill the mold with jelly. Care must be taken in unmolding

two tablespoonfuls of granulated gelatine which has soaked
for an hour in a quarter cupful of cold chicken stock. When
the gelatine has dissolved, remove it from the fire and add
one and one half cupfuls of the fine chicken meat. When
the mixture begins to thicken stir it perfectly smooth and
fold in a half pint of cream whipped to a stiff froth. Turn

gelatine which has soaked for an hour in half a cupful of
cold water. When it has cooled add half a cupful of oil,
a tablespoonful of vinegar or of lemon juice, half a teaspoonful
of salt, a dash of pepper, and the beaten yolk of an egg.
When it begins to set spread it over the fish with a knife.
It will give a smooth, polished yellow covering. Garnish with
slices of pickled beets stamped into various shapes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bass, salmon, bluefish, and halibut are good varieties to
serve cold. They may be masked with the aspic mayonnaise
given above, or with a plain, thick mayonnaise, or with tartare
sauce, or with maître d’hôtel butter. The covering
should be spread with a knife to make it smooth, and the
fish kept in a cool place until the time of serving. Hard-boiled
eggs, capers, pickles, lettuce, watercress, and parsley
are suitable garnishes.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>JELLIED CUTLETS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Cut cold boiled sheepshead or other fish into flat, even
pieces, each piece a size suitable for one portion. Lay them
in a pan, leaving spaces between them. Place on each piece
a thin slice of hard-boiled egg, then pour over them just
enough aspic jelly to cover them. The aspic should have
a little lemon juice or vinegar mixed with it to make it tart.
When the jelly is set, cut the pieces apart with a sharp
knife and arrange them on a dish with creamed horseradish
sauce.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>FISH IN THE GARDEN</h4>

<p class='c018'>Skin a cold boiled trout, bass, or other fish. Cover it with
mayonnaise, or with maître d’hôtel butter. Garnish it with
aspic jelly and surround it with vegetables molded in jelly
as in illustration <a href='#fig-006'>No. 6</a>. Use peas, beans, celery, etc.</p>

<h4 class='c030'>CREAM CHEESE WITH BAR-LE-DUC CURRANTS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Beat with a fork a square of Philadelphia cream cheese,
or of domestic Neufchâtel, until it is light and smooth.
Whip three tablespoonfuls of cream to a stiff froth. Mix the
cheese and whipped cream together lightly and pile the
mixture on a dish in which it is to be served. Put it in a cool
place. Just before serving pour over it a glassful of Bar-le-Duc
red currants.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>HOT DESSERTS</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c031'>FARINA CROQUETTES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Put two cupfuls of milk and half a teaspoonful of salt
into a double boiler. When the milk is hot add half a cupful
of farina, and moisten with a little milk to make it smooth.
Cook about twenty minutes, or until it is well thickened,
then add the yolk of an egg. When it is cold mold it into
small croquettes. Roll the croquettes in egg and white
bread crumbs, or cracker dust, and fry in smoking-hot fat
to a bright yellow color.</p>

<p class='c008'>Serve with maple sugar scraped from the cake.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>HUCKLEBERRY PUDDING</h4>

<div class='lg-container-l c035'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>2 cupfuls of flour,</div>
      <div class='line'>½ cupful of granulated sugar,</div>
      <div class='line'>2 cupfuls of berries,</div>
      <div class='line'>1 heaping teaspoonful of baking powder,</div>
      <div class='line'>½ saltspoonful of salt,</div>
      <div class='line'>1 teaspoonful of butter,</div>
      <div class='line'>Milk.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mix well the sugar, salt, and baking powder with the
flour, then rub in a teaspoonful of butter, and stir in quickly
enough milk to make a batter which will drop from the spoon.
Add the berries well floured, and turn the mixture into a
greased quart pudding-mold. Steam or boil it for half an
hour.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>It should be mixed quickly and the water should not be
allowed to fall below the boiling-point while the pudding
is cooking. Serve with any pudding sauce.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING</h4>

<div class='lg-container-l c035'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 cupful of stale crumb of bread,</div>
      <div class='line'>2 cupfuls of milk,</div>
      <div class='line'>½ cupful of sugar,</div>
      <div class='line'>3 squares of unsweetened chocolate,</div>
      <div class='line'>½ teaspoonful of vanilla,</div>
      <div class='line'>1 egg.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Scald the milk and turn it over the bread, broken into
small pieces. Let it soak until the bread is soft, then beat it
with a fork to a smooth pulp and add the chocolate, melted,
the sugar, vanilla, and yolk of the egg, also a dash of salt.
Lastly fold in the white of the egg whipped to a stiff froth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>COCOANUT BREAD PUDDING</h4>

<p class='c018'>Pour a cupful of scalded milk over a cupful of broken
bits of crumb of bread. Let the bread soak until softened,
then beat it to smoothness. Add a cupful of grated cocoanut,
half a cupful of sugar, a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and
the yolks of two eggs. Mix well, and then add the whites
of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth. Bake in a moderate
oven for thirty minutes. Serve hot or cold.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>FIG PUDDING</h4>

<p class='c018'>Weigh three eggs; take the same weight of butter, sugar,
figs, and of crumb of bread. Chop the figs, put a little hot
water on them, and cook them to a pulp. Grate the bread
to very fine crumbs. Mix together the butter and sugar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>add the yolks of the eggs, then the figs and the crumbs,
and lastly the whites of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth.
Turn the mixture into a covered quart mold, and steam for
two and a half hours; or put it into individual timbale molds,
set them into a pan of water, cover them with a greased
paper, and cook in an oven for thirty minutes, or until firm
to the touch. At the moment of serving pour over them a
little rum or brandy and light it with a taper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Serve with wine sauce, or with any other pudding sauce.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>GREEN-GAGE PUDDING</h4>

<p class='c018'>Butter well a quart granite-ware basin. Arrange on the
bottom a layer of green-gage plums (California canned
plums), then fill the dish heaping full of the crumb of stale
bread cut into dice. Beat two eggs enough to break them, and
mix them with two cupfuls of milk. Pour the egg and milk
mixture slowly over the bread with a spoon, so the bread will
soak up the liquid. Set the pudding-dish in a pan of water
and bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. Let it stand
a few minutes, then invert it on a dish and do not lift it
off the tin for a few minutes longer. Serve with a sauce
made of a cupful of juice from the can, with a heaping
tablespoonful of sugar added to it and then boiled until
clear.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>TAPIOCA PUDDING WITH PRUNES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Soak three tablespoonfuls of tapioca in cold water for
two hours. Use two and a half cupfuls of water. Stew
dried prunes until they begin to swell. Add to the soaked
tapioca (there should be four heaping tablespoonfuls of it)
three tablespoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful of butter, and
two cupfuls of milk or water. Spread a layer of prunes over
the bottom of a quart pudding-dish, then fill the dish with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the tapioca mixture and bake it twenty-five to thirty-five
minutes in a slow oven.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>SAUTÉD BANANAS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Select bananas that are not quite ripe. Peel and cut them
in two lengthwise. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a sauté-pan;
when it bubbles add a tablespoonful of sugar and lay
in the bananas. When the bananas are tender take them
out carefully and lay them in an even row on a hot dish.
Add half a cupful of cream to the pan and mix it well
with the butter and sugar. The sugar should be cooked
enough to give a caramel flavor. Add two or three tablespoonfuls
of sherry, or just enough to take away the very
sweet taste. Pour this sauce over the bananas.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>BAKED BANANAS, No. 1</h4>

<p class='c018'>Select bananas that are not quite ripe, detach the skins.
Bake the bananas in the skins for twenty to thirty minutes,
or until tender but not soft. Turn them out of the skins,
lay them in an even row on a hot dish, and pour over them
some melted currant jelly.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>BAKED BANANAS, No. 2</h4>

<p class='c018'>Mix two tablespoonfuls of butter with three tablespoonfuls
of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, and place
it on the fire to melt the butter. Peel bananas and lay
them uncut in a baking-pan; pour over them the buttered
mixture and bake them until tender, basting them frequently.
Place them in an even row on a flat dish and
pour over them the liquor from the pan.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>BAKED QUINCES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Peel and core the quinces, then cut them in halves and
bake them in a pan with a very little water until tender.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>When they are cooked, spread the tops with butter and a
plentiful amount of sugar. Serve hot. Pass butter and
sugar.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>SOUFFLÉS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Soufflés are one of the most elegant dessert dishes. They
are esteemed for their delicacy rather than their richness,
and the difficulty in making them gives them distinction,
as they are usually presented only from the hand of an expert
cook. There is no reason, however, that any one should
not succeed in making a perfect soufflé, though it is one of the
popular delusions that they are very difficult to make. With
intelligent care about the heat of the oven, a soufflé can be
made with less trouble than is given to many other simple
desserts. The whites of eggs must be beaten until filled with
air. They are then placed in a moderate oven, where the
heated air expands and puffs up the whole mass. The baking
is continued until the air-cells are enough hardened to
support the weight, and the dish must be served at once and
before the imprisoned air cools and the mass collapses.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>STRAWBERRY SOUFFLÉ</h4>

<p class='c018'>Beat to a stiff, dry froth the whites of as many eggs as
needed, allowing one white for each person and one for the
dish, then fold in lightly enough strawberry jam to sweeten
it; or use strawberry pulp and sugar. Turn it into a pudding-dish
and bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes.
Serve at once. The soufflé must go directly from the oven to
the table.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>FRUIT AND OTHER SOUFFLÉS</h4>

<p class='c018'>To the whipped whites of eggs may be added half the
number of yolks and powdered sugar enough to sweeten, or
chocolate, or any jam, or softened jelly, or fruit juice, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>the pulp of any fruit with the juice drained off. Fruit must
be pressed through a purée sieve to make the pulp fine and
soft.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>BURNING PEACHES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Place California canned whole peaches and the juice in a
deep dish. Just before serving pour over them some brandy
or rum and light it with a taper.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>BURNING CHERRIES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Serve California white cherries in the same way as directed
above for peaches.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>COLD DESSERTS</h3>
<h4 class='c031'>APPLES RICHELIEU</h4>

<p class='c018'>Take out the cores of well-flavored apples and cut them
crosswise into halves. Simmer them in sugar and water until
tender. Let them cool. Lay several pieces of sliced blanched
almonds straight, at regular intervals, upon the flat sides of
the apples. Sprinkle them with powdered sugar and set
them in the oven a minute to brown the sugar. Place candied
cherries cut in halves upon the apples between the almonds.
Just before serving put spoonfuls of whipped cream at intervals
on a flat dish and place the cold apples upon the
cream; or press the cream through a pastry-bag in circles
around the apples.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>STEWED APPLES, No. 1</h4>

<p class='c018'>Select apples of uniform size and shape. Remove the cores
and peel them carefully. Put them into hot water with sugar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and lemon juice. Cook them slowly until tender, but not so
long that they lose shape. When they are cold fill the centers
with sweetened and flavored boiled rice and cover them with
apricot or any jam. Sprinkle them with blanched almonds
cut in strips.</p>
<h4 class='c031'>STEWED APPLES, No. 2</h4>

<p class='c018'>Prepare the apples as for No. 1. Fill the centers with
well-flavored apple purée, or with apple jelly mixed with
chopped raisins. Sprinkle them with granulated sugar and
stick into them blanched almonds cut into strips and slightly
browned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Serve with cream, if convenient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Apple purée and apple jelly can be made from the parings
and cores of the apples. Put these trimmings in a saucepan
with a little water and cook them to a pulp. Press the pulp
through a sieve for the purée, or strain it through a cloth
for the juice. Return the juice to the fire, let it boil a minute,
then add half a pound of hot sugar to a cupful of
juice. Stir until the sugar is dissolved, and boil until a few
drops put on a cold plate jelly. Turn it into glasses to set.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>BAKED APPLES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Peel and core good-flavored, tart apples. Put a small piece
of butter in each one and sprinkle them with sugar so they
will brown well. Put them in a pan with a little water and
bake until tender, then remove and put on each one two drops
of almond extract. Add a little sugar to the water in the pan
and cook it down to a thick syrup, then strain it slowly over
the apples to glaze them; or stick three cloves into each apple
before baking them, and omit the almond extract; or fill
the centers with the sugar, lemon peel, and stick cinnamon
before baking, or with blanched almonds and raisins after
baking.</p>

  <h4 class='c030'>COMPOTE OF FIGS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Put a pound of pulled figs in a bowl and cover them with
water. Let them soak for several hours, or until they are
softened and expanded, then press each one into natural
shape and pile them on a dish. Take the water in which
they were soaked, add enough sugar to sweeten it, and a
thick slice of lemon. Boil it until it is a good syrup, then
pour it over the figs. Let the figs cool before serving. Or to
each cupful of fig water add a cupful of sugar and boil it
to the crack, then pour it slowly over the figs. This will
give them a coating of sugar. Serve with whipped cream
flavored with kirsch.</p>

<p class='c008'>The figs, being very sweet, are improved by using a flavoring
which is sharp like lemon or kirsch. If lemon is used,
pour the juice over the figs, as it will curdle the cream if
mixed with it.</p>

as in illustration. To the water in which the pears were

<p class='c018'>Cut bananas into slices one quarter of an inch thick. Arrange
them in a pile in the center of the dish and place
around them spoonfuls of whipped cream. The cream may
be flavored with sherry or vanilla, but use no sugar, as the
fruit is sweet enough without it.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM</h4>

<p class='c018'>Mix enough sugar with cream to sweeten it thoroughly,
and then whip it until it is stiff and dry. A half pint of
cream is enough for a quart of berries. When ready to
serve, mix the berries in the cream and serve them piled on a

Add as much sugar to a half pint of cream as will be

froth. At the moment of serving, mix together lightly the
peaches and cream; or an hour or more before serving, mix
the cream and fruit, put it in a covered mold, and pack in
ice and salt. Use but little salt, for the object is to make
the peaches very cold, but not to freeze them.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the mixture is firm enough to stand without spreading, and
any little point left by the beater remains erect. Success
depends on the eggs being sufficiently beaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mixture can be made into various shapes with a spoon,
but is better molded by being pressed through a pastry-bag.
The tops can be smoothed and any irregularities effaced with
a clean wet knife. The shapes should be arranged on paper
placed on inverted baking-tins, and set in a moderate oven
to form a thin crust, and to color lightly the tops, and then
placed on the hot shelf of the range to dry. If the meringues

in diameter, according to size desired. Any round utensil
of right size can be used for guide. Press the meringue
through the tube, following the circles marked on the paper.
One of the rings—the top one—should be made more ornamental
than the other. This is easily done by moving the
tube while the mixture is passing through it. With a wet
knife make a narrow, smooth, flat surface on the top of the
under ring. Lay the papers holding the rings on inverted
baking-tins, and put them in a moderate oven for a few minutes
to color them and form a crust. Watch carefully that
they do not get too brown. When lightly colored, remove
them to the hot shelf to dry. When they are sufficiently firm
take them carefully off the paper, turn them over, break
in the bottoms, then return them to the shelf to continue the
drying. Place one ring on top of the other, and just before
serving fill the center with whipped cream.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class='c030'>BAVARIAN CREAM GARNISHED WITH CREAM-CAKES</h4>

<p class='c018'>Make a Bavarian cream (see “Century Cook Book,” page
400), and turn it into a flat tin to harden. Have it about
half an inch thick. When it is set, cut it into pieces two and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>a half to three inches square, and arrange them, overlapping,
in the center of a dish. Place around them small cream-cakes
of one inch in diameter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cornstarch pudding, jelly, or any mixture firm enough
to be sliced can be served in this way. Left-over jelly can
be melted and molded again in a layer, or it may be combined
with custard, cream, crumbed cake, or anything suitable
that may be at hand, and turned into a layer-tin to
stiffen; then cut and serve as above. Any small cakes or
sliced cake cut into rounds may be substituted for the cream-cakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chocolate Bavarian garnished with small cakes covered
with white icing makes a good combination.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>PIES AND TARTS</h3>
<h4 class='c030'>PUFF-PASTE</h4>

<p class='c018'>Puff-paste is made of equal weights of butter and flour.
The flour is made into a paste, the butter is worked until
it is flexible, and they are then rolled together and folded
several times so that many distinct layers of butter and
paste are obtained. During the rolling air is imprisoned,
and in baking the air-cells expand, separate the layers, and
so inflate the pastry.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to effect this result, it is necessary to keep the
pastry dry and cold, and the butter cold, so that they will
not mix in rolling, but be pressed into thin sheets. Careful
handling is necessary. Many failures are the result of pressing
the paste in spots with the fingers, which prevents its
rising evenly, if at all. A marble slab is desirable for rolling
the paste on, as it helps to keep it cold.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Either of the following mixtures may be used:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c026'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>No. 1. 1 pound of butter,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>1 pound of flour (pastry flour preferred),</div>
      <div class='line in6'>About 1 pound of cold water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-l c026'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No. 2. 1 pound of butter,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>1 cupful of flour,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>1 cupful of water,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>White of one egg.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Cut one sixth of the butter into the flour for the paste.</p>

<p class='c008'>No salt is needed if salted butter is used.</p>

<p class='c008'>Put the flour on the slab, chop into it, using a knife, one
sixth of the butter, then moisten it with the water into which
has been stirred the beaten white of one egg. The exact
amount of water cannot be given, as that depends upon the
dryness of the flour, but care must be taken to have the
paste of the right consistency. It should be neither too hard
to roll easily, nor so soft that it will stick, but have a flexible,
dry consistency. Work it for a few minutes with the
hands to a perfect smoothness. Roll it to a rectangular
shape (a little longer than broad), and about a half inch
in thickness. The paste can be handled with impunity at
this stage, and care should be taken to roll it to an even thickness
and to have the edges straight and the corners square.
When just right, fold it over, wrap it in a napkin, put it in a
pan, and place the pan upon ice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Work the butter with a spoon or a pat until it is smooth
and flexible, and press out as much of the water it contains
as possible, as this wets the paste and may make it sticky.
Mold the butter into a smooth, flattened square cake and set
it on ice.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the paste and the butter are perfectly cold lay the
paste on the slab, place the cake of butter in the center, and
fold the paste over it, first on the sides, and then the ends.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>The paste should be long enough to fold the end pieces entirely
across the cake of butter. Roll it out into a strip three
times longer than broad. Rolling is made easier by lightly
pounding as well as rolling the paste. Keep the edges even,
and finish by having the corners square and the whole of
uniform thickness. Fold the strip twice, making three even
layers, and place it on the ice again, wrapped in a napkin,
to prevent it from gathering moisture. When it is entirely
cold, roll it out again and fold it in the same way. Strike
the edges to keep the folds from separating, and turn the
paste so as to roll it in the opposite direction from the previous
time. Endeavor to keep the edges straight and corners
square, so the layers will be even. After each folding
and rolling, it is said to have one “turn,” and the pastry
is not finished until it has had six to eight turns. The rolling
becomes more difficult as the layers get thinner, and great
care must be used not to let the butter break through. This
will happen if it is not kept very cold; so, unless the rolling
is done in a very cold room, it is safer to put it on the ice
after each turn. If the butter shows signs of coming
through, cover the spot with flour, and set it away at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>The paste should also be very cold when cut into shapes, so
that the edges will not stick together; and again, it should be
very cold before being put into the oven.</p>

<p class='c008'>The oven should be hot. A simple test of the heat is
to place a piece of writing-paper in the oven for ten minutes.
If at the end of that time the paper is a light yellow, the heat
is right for vol-au-vent and large pieces. If it is a light-brown
color, it is about the heat used for baking bread, and is
right for patty-shells.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a little practice the making of puff-paste becomes
an easy matter. The rolling need not be done all in one day,
for if the paste is kept dry and cold, and not allowed to form
a crust, it will keep for several days. So many high-class
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>dishes can be made of puff-paste, it is desirable to accomplish
the art of making it.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>JAM TART</h4>

<p class='c018'>Tart cases may be prepared the same as vol-au-vent cases,
page 71, except that the paste should be rolled not more than
half an inch thick when ready to be cut; or, instead of cutting
the border in the paste, as for vol-au-vents, a strip of paste
one inch wide may be laid around the edge. The strips
should be cut diagonally on the ends, and these edges moistened
so they will stick together where joined. Lay the
strip carefully around the slightly moistened border of the
bottom piece, paint the top with egg, and bake in a hot oven
for thirty minutes. Remove carefully the top of the center,
and take out any uncooked paste, return it to the oven to
dry the inside.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before using, heat the tart again to make it crisp, and
when cool spread the inside with a layer of any kind of jam
or preserved fruit, put on the center piece, which was taken
off to get out the uncooked paste, and cover the entire center
with jam. Serve it on a lace paper.</p>
<h4 class='c030'>TARTLET SHELLS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Use puff-paste trimmings. Roll the paste thin, shape it
to the pans, being careful to press the paste as little as possible.
Trim the edges with a sharp knife. Put a piece of
paper in the bottom of each one, and fill the tartlet cases with
dried peas, beans, or rice, and bake in a hot oven ten to
fifteen minutes. When well browned, remove the filling,
being particularly careful, if rice is used, that every grain
is picked off the crusts. Return the shells to the oven for a
minute to dry the insides.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>These shells can be kept for some time, but should be
freshened before using by being heated again. Fill them,
just before serving, with any kind of jam or preserve, or with
any freshly stewed fruits, or with creamed minced meat.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4 class='c030'>STRAWBERRY TARTLETS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Use tartlet shells made of any good pastry, puff-paste trimmings
preferred. Just before serving, freshen the shells
by heating them, if they have been kept some time, and fill
with stewed fresh strawberries. Serve the juice separately
in a sauce-dish.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prepare the strawberries, put them in a saucepan and
cover them with enough sugar to sweeten them. Let them
stand in a warm place until the juice moistens the sugar.
Cook them slowly until the berries are softened, but not so
long that they lose their shape.</p>

<h4 class='c030'>FRANGIPANE TARTLETS</h4>

<p class='c018'>Line patty-pans with puff-paste rolled one quarter of an
inch thick. Cut the paste an inch larger than the pans, and
fit it as carefully as possible, pressing it lightly with the
broad finger into the flutings. Prick the bottom crust and
lay on it a slice of bread cut to the size of the bottom of the
pan. This is to prevent the bottom crust from rising and to
leave the sides to puff, as the light pastry is an important
part of these tartlets. Bake in a hot oven about fifteen minutes.
When done remove any uncooked paste and fill with
frangipane cream. Cover the whole top with meringue,
piling it high in the center, and smooth it with a wet knife.
Make a border one half an inch wide of chopped almonds
which have been blanched and browned. Place in the center
a half cherry and two pieces of angelica to imitate a flower.</p>

<h4 class='c030'>CURRANT SHORTCAKE</h4>

<p class='c018'>This shortcake will be liked as well as, if not better than,
one made of strawberries. The latter has an established
reputation, which is based largely upon its attractive appearance,
but, as a rule, it is disappointing to the taste. Shortcake
can be made quite as inviting with currants as with
strawberries, and the tartness of the fruit gives it a flavor
which is especially grateful in hot weather, when currants
are in season.</p>

<p class='c008'>Receipt for one currant shortcake which is enough to serve
to six persons:</p>

<p class='c008'>Make a biscuit dough as follows: Sift together twice two
cupfuls of flour, one and a half teaspoonfuls of baking-powder,
and a half teaspoonful of salt (they must be thoroughly
mixed). When this is done, rub in one rounded teaspoonful
of butter or lard or cottolene, then add enough milk to make
a soft dough. Use a fork to stir in the milk. Mix it lightly
and quickly together, making the paste a little too soft to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>roll. Turn it into a well-greased pie-tin, smooth the top with
a wet knife, and put it at once into a hot oven to bake for
thirty minutes. When it is taken from the oven trim the
edges and split the biscuit in two, using two forks so as to
tear, not cut, it apart. Spread each half with butter while
it is still hot.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stem a box of currants. Reserve a few of the finest ones
to decorate the top of the shortcake. Put the rest of the
currants into a bowl and mash them, add enough sugar to
sweeten to taste, and let them stand an hour or more before
using them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spread the mashed currants over one half of the buttered
biscuit, lay the other half on it. Cover the top with meringue
made of the whipped whites of two eggs sweetened
with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Decorate with
whole currants as shown in illustration.</p>

<p class='c008'>It can be more elaborately decorated by pressing the
meringue through a pastry-bag and tube into ornamental
shapes, and placing currants on it as the fancy dictates.</p>

<p><span class='small'>NO. 158. PINEAPPLE USED AS A CENTERPIECE.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This is a well-selected pine called the sugar-loaf on account
of its tapering to a point on top. The top and bottom are
cut off square, and then the rind on the sides. The inside
is cut into slices quarter of an inch thick, and left together
in natural shape. The rind is then fitted around it and,
if necessary, held in place with wooden toothpicks used as
skewers. These will not show, and can be easily removed at
the time of serving. Use the pine as a table ornament or
centerpiece.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 1. The rind is removed from the pine shown in illustration
No. 158; it is then covered with sugar and
passed.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 2. The pineapple has been cut into slices quarter of an
inch thick, and then in halves. The half slices are
stood on edge and powdered sugar is placed in the
center of the circle.</p>
<p class='c024'>Pineapple is much better in thick slices. The less
taste of the knife the better. Cut in this way, there
is no difficulty about the pieces standing in place as
shown in illustration.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 3. Cut the pineapple into slices quarter of an inch thick,
and then into quarters. Arrange the quarters, standing
on edge, diagonally around the mound of boiled
rice. Place the sprout of the pine in the center of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the mound of rice. Have the rice sweetened and flavored.
Sherry or maraschino are good flavorings
to use.</p>

<p class='c024'>Cornstarch pudding, blancmange, or any simple
jelly, can be used instead of the rice.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 4. Cut a pineapple into slices quarter of an inch thick.
With a small biscuit-cutter stamp out the hard centers,
leaving the pineapple in rings. Arrange the
rings, overlapping, in a circle. Sprinkle them with
granulated sugar, and garnish with a small leaf of
the pine laid in each hole.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'><b>Pulled pineapple</b>. This is a delicious way of serving the
pine when it is very ripe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cut off the rind, and with a small, pointed knife take out
the eyes. Put a fork in the hard core to hold it, and with
a second fork tear off the soft pulp. Pile the pieces in a glass
dish and sprinkle them plentifully with sugar. Let it stand
a few minutes to extract the juice before serving.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CHERRIES</h3>

<p class='c023'>No. 1. Tie the cherries together by the stems into bunches
resembling bunches of grapes. If convenient, have
bunches of red and white cherries on the same dish.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 2. Turn lace papers into cornucopias and fill them with
cherries tied into even bunches; let the stems turn to
the points of the cornucopias, so the fruit only shows
in the opening.</p>

shape, the points in.</p>

  <h3 class='c017'>COCOANUT CREAM-CAKE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Use any cake mixture for the layers. The orange-cake
mixtures are recommended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Make a filling as follows: put in a saucepan,</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c026'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1 cupful of milk,</div>

      <div class='line'>A piece of butter the size of a nutmeg.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mix them and let them come to the boiling-point, then add
slowly a heaping tablespoonful of cornstarch, moistened with
a tablespoonful of milk, and stir until the mixture is thickened.
Remove it from the fire and add the beaten yolk of an
egg. When it cools and is beginning to set, spread it over
the tops of both layers of cake and place one on the other.
Trim the edges. Sprinkle the top with powdered sugar or
with grated cocoanut.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cake in the illustration has in the center a confectioner’s
rose. Various kinds of sugar flowers can be bought
at bakers’ supply stores.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CAKE DECORATED WITH STAR</h3>

<p class='c018'>Paint the surface of an inverted loaf of any kind of cake
with white of egg, then sift over it while it is moist enough
powdered sugar to whiten it. Place a star stencil on top, get
it exactly in the center, and sift powdered cocoa into the
opening.</p>

<p class='c008'>The star could be made of granulated sugar, colored pink,
if preferred, or a space could be filled with small candies
called “hundreds and thousands.”</p>
<h3 class='c017'>TO MAKE STENCIL</h3>

<p class='c018'>Place a piece of stiff paper over the bottom of the inverted
pan in which the cake was baked and crease it enough to indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the circle. Outline the circle with a pencil and draw
inside of it two other circles, the first half an inch and the
second one and a half inches inside the outer one. Draw
two lines across the circles at right angles, then two more
lines at equal distances between the others, then draw pointed
lines in the eight spaces between the second and third circles.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CAKE DECORATED IN TWO SHADES OF WHITE ICING</h3>

<p class='c018'>The illustration shows a simple pattern for decorating a
loaf of cake. The cake can be made of any mixture. It
is first covered with icing No. 3, page <a href='#Page_192'>192</a>, which gives
a clear icing and makes a good background for the white
lines. If it does not run evenly dip a knife in water and
smooth it. Most irregularities can be smoothed out with a
clean, wet knife. The lines are made of decorating icing,
which is white (No. 16, page <a href='#Page_195'>195</a>), pressed through a pastry-bag
with tube of small opening. Each one of the center
figures of the pattern holds a small silvered pellet of candy.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>ICED CAKE DECORATED WITH PINK BOW-KNOT</h3>

<p class='c018'>Cover the cake with a smooth, hard icing (No. 2 or No. 4).
Put decorating icing (No. <a href='#Page_16'>16</a>), colored pink with cochineal,
into a pastry-bag with tube of plain, small opening, and
trace a bow-knot with it. Fill the space between the outlines
with pink icing, and flatten it, to look like a ribbon, with
a wet knife.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the tracing is not satisfactory, take it off with a knife,
wipe the cake with a dry cloth, and make another trial. A
little practice with a pencil, drawing a knot of the right size
on paper, will enable one to trace more easily the outlines on
the cake.</p>

of each one and take out a thin layer of the cake.
Cover the rest of the cakes with icing, or the cakes
may be moistened with water and then rubbed over
with powdered sugar to whiten them. Place in the

<p class='c008'>In the illustration some of the cakes have only the decorating

<h3 class='c017'>CREAM-CAKES</h3>

<p class='c018'>To a cupful of hot water add a tablespoonful of butter,
a tablespoonful of sugar, and a dash of salt. When the
sugar is dissolved and the butter melted add a cupful and a
quarter of flour. Cook it, stirring all the time, until it is
a smooth paste that leaves the sides of the pan. Let it cool
a few minutes and then add three or, if necessary, four eggs,
beating in well one at a time. The paste should have sufficient
consistency to hold its shape without spreading when
dropped from a spoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Put the paste into a pastry-bag with a plain tube of half-inch
opening and press it through into balls from three

then add half a teaspoonful of vanilla or other flavoring.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>CREAM-CAKES, ICED</h3>

<p class='c018'>Make cream-cakes two inches in diameter, fill them with

chopped blanched almonds.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>LITTLE CREAM-CAKES WITH CARAMEL ICING</h3>

<p class='c018'>Make cream-cakes of one inch diameter. Fill them with cream filling,

Place each one in a little paper box and serve with other fancy cakes.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>MERINGUE MUSHROOMS</h3>

<p class='c018'>Place meringue mixture (see page <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>) in a pastry-bag
with a plain tube, and press it through into shapes like mushroom
caps. This is done by holding the tube still until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>enough of the egg is pressed through to form a cap of the size
desired and high in the center. With a wet knife lightly
press down the point left by the tube, and, if necessary,
smooth the whole top. On another paper make forms resembling
mushroom stems, and with a wet knife flatten the tops.
Place all in a cool oven for a few minutes to form a crust,
but do not let them color. When a little firm place them on
the hot shelf to dry. Sprinkle the tops of the caps with
powdered cocoa, and with the finger darken an edge around
the flat under surface to represent the gills of a mushroom.
Moisten the tops of the stems with white of egg and stick
them on the caps.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>COCOANUT MERINGUES</h3>

<p class='c018'>Place meringue mixture (page <a href='#Page_150'>150</a>) in a pastry-bag with
plain tube of one-half inch opening, and press it through on
to paper in pieces about three inches long. Cut the meringue
from the tube to give clean ends. Sprinkle the tops with as
much grated cocoanut as will adhere. Desiccated cocoanut
can be used. Place in a moderate oven to color it lightly,
then remove to the hot shelf of the range to dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>These meringues are also pretty if pressed through a star-tube
into rings.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>GALETTES</h3>

<p class='c018'>Roll puff-paste trimmings as thin as possible. Stamp it all
over with some rough surface which will pierce the paste
(a wooden meat-pounder was used for those in illustration).
Then cut with a plain biscuit-cutter into round or oblong
shapes. Lay these on a baking-sheet, paint the tops all over
evenly with egg, and sprinkle them with powdered sugar.
Bake in a medium oven until lightly colored.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every scrap of paste can be utilized for these cakes, which
are very nice with ice-cream or for afternoon tea-cakes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Roll puff-paste to one-eighth inch thickness. Cut it into
strips one inch wide and three inches long. Spread one
half of the strips with a thin layer of any kind of jam, and
cover with the remaining strips, making sandwich-like
pieces. Bake in a hot oven for ten minutes, or until done,

<p class='c024'><b>For orange icing</b>. Use strained orange juice instead
of water, or soak the grated peel in hot water for a
little while, and then strain it through a cloth and
use the water.</p>

<p class='c024'><b>For yellow icing</b>. Dilute the yolk of an egg with a

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span><b>For pistache icing</b>. Color the water with green coloring
paste, and flavor it with one teaspoonful of orange-flower

<p class='c024'><b>For pink icing</b>. Use strawberry juice, or color water
with a little cochineal.</p>

<p class='c024'><b>For wine-cakes</b>. Use sherry instead of water.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 2. <b>Hard, white icing</b>. Take the unbeaten white of an
egg, dilute it with a very little water and flavor it.
Stir in powdered sugar until it is of the consistency

<p class='c024'>This makes a hard, white icing.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 3. <b>Boiled icing</b>. Put a cupful of granulated sugar and
a half cupful of hot water into a saucepan and stir

<p class='c024'>This makes a clear icing, and is a good covering

<p class='c025'>No. 4. <b>Boiled icing, No. 2</b>. Cook, without stirring, after the
sugar is dissolved, one cupful of granulated sugar
and one quarter cupful of hot water until it threads,
then pour it slowly over the whipped white of one
egg. Beat the mixture all the time, and until it is
cool enough to spread.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>No. 5. <b>Maple icing</b>. Boil to the thread or soft-ball stage
a cupful of maple sugar with a quarter of a cupful
of hot water to dissolve it, or use maple syrup. Pour
it slowly over the whipped white of one egg as in
No. 4.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 6. <b>Caramel icing</b>. Boil a cupful of granulated sugar,
a half cupful of milk, and a teaspoonful of butter to
the thread or soft-ball stage. Flavor with a few drops
of vanilla and stir until it begins to grain.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 7. <b>Crystal icing</b>. Spread any icing over a cake, and
while it is still moist sprinkle over it the coarse grains
of granulated sugar obtained by sifting.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 8. <b>Powdered sugar</b>. Moisten with a brush the surface
of a cake with the white of an egg diluted with a
tablespoonful of water and stirred just enough to
break the stringiness; then dust it thickly with powdered
sugar, using a sifter. After the egg has dried,
shake off the sugar that does not adhere.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 9. <b>Whipped cream</b>. Flavor a half pint of cream with a
few drops of vanilla and whip it until it is stiff and
dry. Just before serving the cake ornament it with
the whipped cream pressed through a pastry-bag and
star-tube.</p>

<p class='c024'>This cream is used with strawberry cake and with
molasses gingerbread.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 10. <b>Whipped cream with maple flavor</b>. Heat two tablespoonfuls of
maple syrup and dissolve in it one teaspoonful of granulated gelatine
which has been soaked in a tablespoonful of cold water. Let the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>syrup cool so it will not heat the cream, but before
it sets stir it into a half pint of cream. Whip the
cream to a stiff froth and press it through a pastry-bag
and tube on to the cake in an ornamental pattern.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 11. <b>Butter</b>. Whip a half pound of butter until it is
smooth and light, sweeten it with thick sugar syrup
flavored, and add a level tablespoonful of cornstarch.
Press it through a pastry-bag and tube on
to the cake in ornamental designs.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 12. <b>Mocha cream</b>. Whip half a pound of butter, using
a fork, until it is smooth and light. Flavor it with
syrup made of a half cupful of sugar and a quarter
cupful of strong coffee. Add a level tablespoonful
of cornstarch to give the butter more stability.
Press it through a pastry-bag and tube.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 13.<b> Chocolate icing, No. 1</b>. Dissolve one and a half
ounces of unsweetened chocolate in one third cupful
of cream or milk, and add half a teaspoonful of
butter. When this mixture is a little cool add the
beaten yolk of one egg, one half teaspoonful of
vanilla, and enough confectioners’ sugar to make
it spread.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 14. <b>Chocolate icing, No. 2</b>. Melt two ounces of unsweetened
chocolate on a hot pan, remove it from the fire,
and add half a cupful of sugar, one teaspoonful of
butter, and lastly a quarter cupful of milk. Replace
it on the fire and cook until a little dropped
into water will form a soft ball. Pour it over the
cake.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>No. 15. <b>Tutti frutti icing</b>. Cook a cupful of sugar and a
quarter cupful of water to the thread or soft-ball
stage. Turn it slowly on to the whipped white of
one egg. Beat them together and add a tablespoonful
each of chopped blanched almonds, citron cut
in small pieces, seeded raisins, candied cherries cut
into pieces, and angelica cut into bits. Spread it
roughly over the cake. Any combination of fruits
may be used instead of those given above. As this
is a rich icing, it should be used on a plain cake, such
as cup- or sponge-cake.</p>

<p class='c025'>No. 16. <b>Decorating icing</b>. Whip the whites of two eggs to a
very stiff froth, then add slowly powdered sugar
until the mixture is so stiff that every point and
thread left by the beater will hold its place. It requires
beating a long time. It is the same as meringue
mixture, except that it is made hard with
sugar instead of by drying, and takes about a half
cupful of sugar to each egg.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Sprinkle a cake that is going to be frosted with
flour as soon as it is taken from the pan. Before
icing, wipe off the flour. This prevents the icing
from running so much, and makes it easier to spread.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Smooth icings with the broad side of a wet knife.
Wipe the blade clean, and dip it in water each time
it is drawn over the icing. In this way very rough
surfaces can be smoothed.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—Icing left over will keep any length of time, if excluded
from the air and not allowed to dry. Put it
in a cup, cover the cup with a wet cloth, double several
times, and cover the cloth with a saucer.</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—For other icings and directions, see “Century Cook
Book,” page 483.</p>

      <div class='line'>2 tablespoonfuls of sugar,</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of butter, lard, or cottolene,</div>
      <div class='line'>1 tablespoonful of salt,</div>

      <div class='line'>Flour enough to make a thick batter, or about two and three-quarter quarts.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This quantity of material will make three loaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Have the water warm, not hot. Stir into the water the
sugar, salt, softened butter, and the yeast, which has been
dissolved in a tablespoonful of water (yeast is more easily
dissolved in a small quantity of water), then stir in enough
flour to make a batter as thick as can be stirred easily. Stir
and beat the batter well for about ten minutes. Cover the
bread-pan and set it in a warm place (eighty degrees is the
right temperature). When the dough is light, or about
doubled in bulk, stir it down, and beat it well for a few minutes.
Let it rise a second time, and again beat it, then turn
it into the pans, filling them half full. The tops of the
loaves can be made smooth by brushing them with a pastry-brush
dipped in water.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stirring gives a fine texture. The dough rises quickly
after the first rising, and must be watched that it does not
get light enough to sour. Let the loaves rise in the baking-pans
to double in size, then bake in a hot oven for one hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bread made in this way is very light and spongy, and
is much better than that which is made so thick with flour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>that it can be kneaded. It has also the other advantages of
being easier to make, the results are more reliable, and the
objection of too much handling is removed. It requires an
experienced hand to knead bread without making it too
heavy with flour.</p>

<p class='c008'>This bread is made in about three hours. It is the most

  <h3 class='c017'>ROLLED OR MOTTO SANDWICHES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>For rolled sandwiches the bread should be very fresh
and moist, and entirely free from crust. As it is difficult to
cut fresh bread with a knife, use a loaf which is a day old
if a bread-plane is not at hand. Cut it into slices one eighth
of an inch thick, using a sharp knife. It will cut easier if the
crust is first removed from the loaf. Arrange the slices
in a pile and cut them all together into good shape. Wrap
the bread in a wet cloth and let it stand in a cool place for
two hours. The bread will then be moist and pliable enough
to roll without breaking. The slices may be simply buttered,
or they may be spread with any mixture desired. If meat
or fish is used, it should be reduced to paste by chopping
and pounding, and be well seasoned. (See “Century Cook
Book,” page 364.) Use some butter or oil in the mixture,
so the slices will not need to be buttered. Spread the slices
with the paste and roll them carefully, then roll each one in
a piece of paraffin paper, cut long enough to wrap the
sandwich one and a half times, and wide enough to extend
an inch over each end. Twist the ends of the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keep the sandwiches in the ice-box until ready to use, and
serve them with the papers on. Wrapped sandwiches will
keep fresh for forty-eight hours. They are especially suitable
for travelers and for picnics.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>LETTUCE SANDWICHES</h3>

<p class='c018'>Cut fresh bread into slices a little more than one eighth of
an inch in thickness, using the bread-plane if convenient.
Arrange the slices in a pile, and cut the bread into a shape
about four by four and a half inches. This removes the
crusts and leaves all the slices of exactly the same size. Uniformity
in size and shape is one of the points to observe in
making sandwiches. Spread the slices lightly with butter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>which is soft enough to spread evenly without tearing the
bread. Place on each buttered slice a leaf of crisp lettuce
which is large enough to extend a little over the ends of the
slice, and from which the midrib has been removed. Sprinkle
the lettuce plentifully with salt. Roll the slices carefully,
and tie around each one a piece of paper the width of the
bread.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the time of serving, this paper is removed and the
butter will then be sufficiently hardened to keep the rolls
in shape.</p>

<p class='c008'>Place the sandwiches on a plate, cover them with a wet
napkin, and keep them in a cool place until ready to serve.
In this way sandwiches may be kept fresh for twenty-four
hours.</p>
<h3 class='c017'>SANDWICH FILLINGS</h3>

<p class='c018'><b>Chicken and celery</b>. Chop chicken and celery in equal
quantities until they are very fine. Mix them to a paste with
mayonnaise.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Egg filling</b>. Chop hard-boiled eggs until very fine and mix
them to a paste with plain French dressing, or with mayonnaise.</p>

<p class='c008'><b>Ham filling</b>. Put in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of butter,
one teaspoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar,
and the yolks of two eggs. Beat them together, and add
slowly, stirring all the time, three quarters of a cupful of hot
vinegar. Place it on the fire and stir until the mixture is a
little thickened, then add one cupful of minced ham and two
thirds of a cupful of tender celery, also chopped very fine.
Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p class='c008'>This preparation can be kept, to use as needed, if put into
preserve glasses and covered with melted butter or lard.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Cut the bread into slices one eighth of an inch thick, and
remove the crust as directed above. The filling of a sandwich
should be as thick as one of the slices of bread. After
the sandwiches are prepared, using the whole slices, cut them
into the shapes desired. This may be small squares, fingers,
triangles, circles, or hearts, as the fancy or occasion dictates.
Where a variety of sandwiches are being served at the same
time, each variety should be cut alike, but of a different
pattern from the others, and the dish garnished distinctively.
For instance, a hard-boiled egg cut lengthwise, a square of
cheese, a few olives, nuts, flowers, or whatever the filling
used, can be placed in the center of the plate, and the sandwiches
arranged in a circle around it. A wishbone makes
a good label for chicken, and parsley or gherkins would
indicate meat mixtures. The brown breads make excellent
sandwiches, and help to give variety. Cucumbers sliced, and
watercress freed from the large stems, may be mixed with
French dressing before being placed in the bread, or they
may be only salted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nasturtium flowers require no seasoning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Olives and nuts are sliced or cut into small pieces, but
should not be cut very fine, as it injures their flavor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cheese may be sliced or grated.</p>

<p class='c008'>See “Century Cook Book,” page 364, for further directions
about mixtures for fillings.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the sandwiches are finished they should be placed
between plates under a light weight, covered with a damp
cloth, and kept in a cool place until the time of serving.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>BRIOCHE</h3>

<p class='c018'>Brioche is a light bun. The mixture is also used for savarins
and babas. See page <a href='#Page_147'>147</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Make a leaven as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>Add to a cupful of tepid milk a yeast-cake and half a
pound of flour. Mix it well and set it in a warm place to rise
until it is very light. It will take about an hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sift on to a rolling-board one pound of flour, and make
a well in the center. Break seven eggs into a bowl, add a
teaspoonful of salt, and beat the eggs enough to break them
thoroughly. Cut three quarters of a pound of butter into
pieces.</p>

<p class='c008'>Put three tablespoonfuls of milk and two tablespoonfuls
of sugar into the well of flour, add a piece of butter and some
of the broken eggs. Work all these together with the hand,
incorporating the flour gradually. Add the eggs and butter
gradually until all are worked in, and continue the working
for some time, then add the leaven and work the whole mixture
for a long time, or until it does not stick. Set it aside
to rise and double in size, work it again, and put it in the
ice-box for twelve hours.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Put a cupful of milk in a saucepan on the fire and let it
come to the scalding-point, then stir in the cornmeal, and
continue to stir until the meal is thoroughly expanded. If
a coarse meal is used, it should cook for a few minutes to
destroy the grainy texture. Remove the meal from, the fire
and stir into it the butter and the sugar. Let it stand until
cool, then add the rest of the milk, the eggs, which have been
beaten (yolks and whites together), the salt, and lastly the
flour, which has been thoroughly mixed with the baking-powder
by sifting. Stir the mixture to smoothness and turn
it into well-buttered gem-pans. Bake in a moderate oven for
about forty-five minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>cornmeal should be thoroughly cooked, and the baking
can be continued until the muffins draw away from the sides
of the pans. The baking should be slow at first, so the
muffins will rise evenly, giving a flat top. This quantity of
mixture will make one dozen large muffins.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
